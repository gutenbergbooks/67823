<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
THE MURDER AT THE T-INVERTED R
</h3>

<p>
Inspector Barker, of the Royal North-West
Mounted Police, raised his frowning
eyes from the weekly report he was scrawling,
to watch absent-mindedly the arrival of
the Calgary express as it roared out from
the arches of the South Saskatchewan bridge
and pulled up at the station.
</p>

<p>
It was a morning ritual of the Inspector's.
Three hundred and sixty-five days of the year,
relatively at the same hour&mdash;if Rocky Mountain
slides, foothill floods, and prairie
snowstorms permitted&mdash;the same train broke in
on the mid-forenoon dullness of the "cow-town"
of Medicine Hat; and the same pair of official
eyes followed it dully but with the determination
of established convention, clinging to it off
and on during its twenty minutes' stop for a
fresh engine and supplies to carry it on its
four days' run eastward.
</p>

<p>
But on Mondays the transcontinental was
favoured with a more concentrated attention.
On that morning Inspector Barker prepared
his weekly report.  A pile of letters and staff
reports scattered his desk; a smaller pile,
the morning's mail, was within reach of his
left hand.  His right clumsily clutched a
fountain pen.  Thirty years of strenuous Mounted
Police duties, from Constable to Inspector,
during a period when Indians, rustlers,
cattle-thieves, and the scum of Europe and Eastern
Canada, were held to a semblance of order
only by the stern hand of the "red-coats,"
had robbed his chirography of any legibility
it ever possessed.
</p>

<p>
His iron-grey hair was rumpled by frequent
delvings of his left hand, and the left needle
of his waxed moustache was sadly out of line.
His tunic was open&mdash;he never removed it
when on duty&mdash;more in capitulation to mental
than to physical discomfort, though Medicine
Hat can startle more records in July than in
the depth of winter, cold-blooded official reports
to the contrary notwithstanding.  His pipe
lay cold beside the half-spilled tobacco pouch
that always adorned the corner of his blotting
pad.
</p>

<p>
Over on the station platform before his
window the crowd thinned.  A man ran along
the top of the cars with a hose, thrusting it
into a tiny trap-door, flicking up a slide in
the nozzle, holding it a moment till the tanks
below filled, flicking the slide down again,
and then on to the next-trap door.  A butcher's
boy with a heavy basket on his arm scrambled
down Main Street, crossed the track, and
galloped with shuffling feet along the platform
to the diner.  The conductor drew his watch,
examined it critically, raised his hand, and
the fresh engine started noisily for its relief
at the next divisional point, Swift Current.
</p>

<p>
Any morning that the Inspector was on duty
the arrival of the Calgary express produced a
similar scene in and out of the Police
barracks&mdash;except a few of the trimmings indicative of
mental irritation; any <i>Monday</i> morning you
would find trimmings and all.
</p>

<p>
Yet throughout the tangle of that summer's
special Police task Inspector Barker's mind
reverted in his moments of leisure to the passing
of an innocent daily train.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He was lowering his eyes reluctantly to the
completion of his weekly irritation, when the
desk telephone rang sharply, peremptorily.
He jerked it to him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, sir, to have to report&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Drop the palaver, Faircloth!" snapped
the Inspector.  "I take that for granted."
</p>

<p>
"A murder was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, hold on!  Hold the line a minute!"
</p>

<p>
The Inspector dropped the receiver, scrawled
an illegible but well-known "Barker, Inspector,"
at the bottom of the sheet before him, jammed
it into an envelope and sealed it.  At least
he would have a week of freedom for the task
implied by Corporal Faircloth's interrupted
disclosure.
</p>

<p>
"Now!" he shouted into the telephone,
one hand instinctively buttoning his tunic to
more official formality.
</p>

<p>
Faircloth restarted:
</p>

<p>
"Last night, shortly after midnight, at the
T-Inverted R&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bite it off, for Heaven's sake!" broke
in the Inspector.  "Who, and how, and by whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Billy Windover&mdash;shot&mdash;cattle-thieves!"
the Corporal chipped off.
</p>

<p>
For just the fraction of a second Inspector
Barker waited.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Nothing more?"
</p>

<p>
The Division knew that tone.
</p>

<p>
"Two hours before we were informed,"
apologised the Corporal.  "Trouble on the
telephone line.  Followed the trail&mdash;they got
the cattle as well&mdash;till lost it in fresh tracks
of the round-ups."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector laughed shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Did you expect a paper-chase trail?"
</p>

<p>
The Corporal made no reply.  Usually it
took him a sentence or two to remember the
Inspector's impatience, but for the particular
interview concerned he observed the training
well when he did recall it.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you telephone right away?
Why did you give the trail up?  Oh, damn
it, wait!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment or two the only sound in
the barracks office was the buzzing of the flits
on the dirty window glass.  Thereafter he was
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Any strangers seen out there in the last
couple of days?  Any cowboys off their beats?"
</p>

<p>
"No time yet to enquire, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Get Aspee and Hughes out immediately.
Did the tracks lead toward the Cypress Hills?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Hm-m-m!"
</p>

<p>
"A bit north-east&mdash;far as we could follow."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector paused.  "What's your plan?"
</p>

<p>
"Going to scurry round&mdash;to look for the cattle."
</p>

<p>
It came with just a suggestion of defiance,
as if the speaker were a little ashamed of the
sound of it but was prepared to defend it.  The
Inspector laughed.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you!" he mocked.  "How did
you think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"The very cattle themselves," Faircloth
persisted.  "It happens&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Inspector's laugh became less pleasant.
"And you think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, sir; but it isn't quite as silly as
it sounds.  I know this particular herd almost
as well as their own punchers&mdash;and I think
I know something of brands."
</p>

<p>
"Lad, your optimism is contagious&mdash;but
this dairy-maid tracking is such a new stunt
in the Force.  When you come across
Co-Bossie and Spot give them my compliments
and ask them to drop in some afternoon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He sickened of his own banter.
</p>

<p>
"Get Aspee and Hughes out immediately,"
he rasped.  "Remain yourself within reach
of the phone for fifteen minutes.  I'll have a
campaign then....  Do you happen to recall
that this is the third case of cattle-stealing in
your district in a month? ... By the way,
know anything about dogs&mdash;tracking dogs?
I expect a couple of rippers from down East
in a day or two.  I'll get them out to you.  See
what you've let the Force sink to!  Now
hustle!"
</p>

<p>
He slammed the receiver into its place and
sank back in his chair, chin resting on breast.
A constable, receiving no reply to his knock,
opened the back door softly&mdash;and closed it
again more softly.  He knew that attitude of
his chief.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
MORTON STAMFORD: TENDERFOOT
</h3>

<p>
Corporal Faircloth hung up the
telephone receiver and strolled to the
door, still bridling at the Inspector's
ridicule.  For several minutes he stood looking
thoughtfully out on the familiar prairie scene,
where not another spot of human life or habitation
was visible as far as the dark line of hills
to the south-east.  But an incongruous telephone
line, stretching a zigzag course of rough
poles away into the south-eastern distance,
told of isolated ranch-houses cuddled in
far-away valleys.
</p>

<p>
A dark spot moved into view over a southern
rise and crept along the top.  Faircloth instinctively
seized a pair of field-glasses from a case
hanging beside the door and focused them on
the distant rider, then, content, dropped them
dreamily back.  Away off there lay Dead
Dogie Coulee, just now, he knew, full of cattle.
</p>

<p>
The telephone behind him rang, and he hastened
to it, trying to compose himself for the
Inspector's orders.  But it was not Inspector
Barker.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Faircloth!" called a laughing voice.
"How's the Cypress Hills hermitage?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Stamford!"  Faircloth was thinking
rapidly.  "What's the little editor got on
his mind now?  Make it brief: I'm expecting
the Inspector to call up."
</p>

<p>
"Why has who been murdered by whom?"
</p>

<p>
Faircloth laughed.  "The brevity of it
deserves more than I can tell you.  Who told
you&mdash;anything?"
</p>

<p>
"The Inspector."
</p>

<p>
"Then why not get it all from him?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford chuckled into the telephone at the
other end.
</p>

<p>
"I got the impression that my arrival at
the barracks was inopportune.  The extent of
the particulars I got was a particular request
to betake myself elsewhere.  I betook.  I came
to a friend."
</p>

<p>
"And the friend must fail you.  You're
too hopeful for the West, Stamford.  I'd tell
you all I dare&mdash;you know that.  No, not a bit
of use pleading."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Stamford, "permit me to tell
you to your face that when next I see you
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Faircloth cut him short with a laugh.  "No
threats to the Police, little man.  I'll tell you
what I'll do.  On Thursday I'm coming to
town for the Dunmore Junction cattle shipping.
By the way, as a tenderfoot you should see it.
Drive along out and hear the latest.  Bye-bye!
I'm busy."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Dunmore Junction, bald, bleak and barren,
four miles from Medicine Hat, consisted of
nothing more than a railway station, a freight
shed, and a commodious freight yard, marking
the connecting point of the Crow's Nest branch
of the Canadian Pacific Railway with the
main line.  It could not well be more and remain
the principal shipping station for the vast herds
that roamed the prairies for eighty miles from
Medicine Hat.  The open spaces about the
Junction were necessary for the herding of the
steers awaiting their call to the shipping
stockades.  Even the station staff lived in
Medicine Hat, the shifts changing with the
arrival and passage of the trains to town.
</p>

<p>
Thither Morton Stamford, editor of the
<i>Journal</i>, directed the only trustworthy horse
in town and a good-enough buggy.  As a
new experience he could not afford to miss the
cattle shipping, though the following day was
publication day.
</p>

<p>
Morton Stamford was a tenderfoot.  What
was more deplorable from his point of view,
he looked it.  He was small, fair-haired, mild
and inoffensive of manner, and from stiff hat
to cloth-topped boots was stamped as a fresh
arrival from "the cent-belt," as Western Canada
termed the petty East where the five-cent
piece was not the minimum of exchange.
</p>

<p>
Two months ago he had dropped from the
train at the town of the funny name, attracted
as much by the name as by the advertisement
in <i>The Toronto Globe</i>.  When he had succeeded
in steeling himself to the general atmosphere
of disdain and suspicion, as well as to the
rival occupancy of his room at the hotel, he
discovered sufficient enthusiasm left to inspect
the newspaper he had come to look over.  And,
having decided that the introduction of modified
Eastern methods would be profitable, he had
come to terms with the disgusted English
proprietor whose stubborn adherence to the best
traditions of <i>The Times</i> and <i>The Telegraph</i>
"back home" had, at the end of his resources,
convinced him that Huddersfield or Heaven
was his home, not the riotous, undignified,
unappreciative Canadian West.
</p>

<p>
Already Stamford had seen more of the
real life of the West than many an old-timer
citizen of Medicine Hat.  Such portions of a
spring round-up as were within range of a
buckboard, a bucking contest, and limited
visits to four ranches had almost made him
an authority on Stetsons, chaps, and cowboy
slang.  He simply doted on cowboys, without
discrimination.  He loved the Mounted Police,
too, who had quickly discovered in him a soul
above steers and bronchos; and at his
fingertips was a motley assortment of stories of
doubtful and certain unauthenticity that painted
the future in rosy colours of excited hope
just round the corner.
</p>

<p>
He was small of stature, but imagination
and a capacity for thrills are not corporally
circumscribed.
</p>

<p>
When he arrived, Dunmore Junction was
no longer lonely.  Within two miles of the
station platform was more life than Medicine
Hat had seen since the buffalo drifted drearily
to other hunting-grounds before the civilisation
of the rancher and the barbarism of gory
hunters.  Out there in the rolling folds of the
prairie two thousand head were looking for
the last time on their limitless pastures, kept
under control by a cloud of cowboys, in herds
as distinct as possible according to ownership.
Scarcely a steer was visible, but at intervals
a wildly riding cowboy dashed from a coulee
in pursuit of protest against the extended
restraint.
</p>

<p>
Back of the station, where his livery horse
was tied with the care and insecurity of a
tenderfoot, a dozen bronchos dozed, a few tied
to the rail, most merely with reins thrown to
the ground.  About Stamford the platform
was alive with lounging cowboys in every style
of cowboy dress; and among them the
station-master and his staff, a couple of brakesmen
from the shunting-engine crew, and three or
four ranchers&mdash;scarcely distinguishable from
their own punchers to-day&mdash;were more alertly
eyeing the preparations for the coming task.
</p>

<p>
For two days it would continue.  During
that time several score of cowboys would sleep
and eat on the prairie, fed from their own
mess-wagons, with here and there a bed-wagon,
though in the semi-arid belt about Medicine
Hat there was little danger of rain from June
to September.
</p>

<p>
It was a Red Deer River shipment.  The
thin line of ranchers along the Red Deer, sixty
miles to the north of Medicine Hat, had
combined, but most of the herd belonged to
"Cockney" Aikens, of the H-Lazy Z ranch.
</p>

<p>
Stamford recognised Aikens immediately.
Only a blind man would fail at least to see
him.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens, his nickname derived from
an aggressive English origin he did his best
to flaunt, stood well over six feet without his
riding boots, his big frame wrapped in a wealth
of muscle no amount of careless indolence could
conceal.  Handsome, graceful in spite of his
lazy movements, he seemed to have gone to
brawn.  Laughs came easily to his lips, and
the noise of them made other sounds pause
to listen.  "Cockney" was to him a
compliment; if anyone implied otherwise he was
careful&mdash;and wise&mdash;to conceal it.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, you little tenderfoot!" he called,
as Stamford wound humbly and unseen through
the indifferent wall of Stetson hats, flannel
shirts, and leather or hairy chaps that blocked
the end of the platform.  "Where's that girl
I advertised for?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford grinned.
</p>

<p>
"You're an optimist, Cockney.  Just as I
get some innocent female rounded up to clean
your boots, grill a coyote steak, and wield a
branding iron between times, she finds out the
semi-lunar location of that unearthly ranch of
yours.  I warned you that the <i>Journal</i> might
find the missing link, a mother-in-law, or the
street address of a Cypress Hills wolf, but a
'general' for the Red Deer&mdash;impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"About all I see for it," growled Cockney,
"is to kidnap one&mdash;unless you open your
eyes to the only possible use for a man of your
dimensions and come out to wash my dishes
yourself.  I'll pay you as much as you can
hope to make from that mangy sheet of
yours&mdash;a more honourable living than robbing a
struggling rancher of two shillings for a hopeless
ad."
</p>

<p>
Stamford solemnly produced a large leather
purse and extracted a coin from the cash
department.
</p>

<p>
"Here, you overgrown sponge!  I figure
that ad cost me a quarter in setting, make-up,
run, and paper&mdash;a shilling, if you can
understand no other values.  Here's the other
quarter.  But bear in mind this&mdash;if you take
it I'll show you up.  I'll camp on your trail,
rout out your past crimes, and publish them
to the last drop of blood.  I feel sure you've
committed burglary, murder, or arson somewhere
in your dark career; and, besides, you're an
arrant bully."
</p>

<p>
Though Stamford knew as much&mdash;or as
little&mdash;of Cockney Aikens' past as the rest of
Medicine Hat, and the big rancher's merry and
spendthrift ways belied suspicion of irritation
at the loss of "two shillings," the blatant
exaggeration of the editor failed somehow to
carry off the banter lightly.  Cockney's face
went grim, and a strange silence fell along the
platform.
</p>

<p>
Then Cockney himself smothered it by a
physical retort.  Reaching over, he seized
Stamford's shoulders and lifted him by the coat
at arm's length until their faces were on a
level.
</p>

<p>
"If I had this much added to my stature,"
blustered the editor, in affected fury, vainly
striking out his short arms at the face opposite,
"I'd punch you on the nose."
</p>

<p>
"If you were this size," grinned Aikens,
"I mightn't take liberties.  Just the same,"
he added, with a ring of boyish disappointment
in his voice, "it would be one h&mdash;l of a fight.
You've got the white matter, I guess, but
I'm just spoiling for a rough-and-tumble.  I
haven't had what you might call exercise
since&mdash;" he flushed through his tan, "&mdash;oh, for
a long time."
</p>

<p>
It so happened that everyone, including
Cockney, was thinking of the "exercise" he
had once, largely at the expense of the police,
town and Mounted; and the memory of it to
the one most concerned was not sweet.
</p>

<p>
A long line of cattle cars rolled quietly down
the track before the corrals, a brakesman on
the top keeping up a steady signalling to the
engine.  When the first two cars were opposite
the gangways from the two loading stockades,
his hand shot out and the train came to a
violent halt.  Almost instantly the gates at
the bottom of the gangways opened and two
lines of steers from the crowded, white-fenced
pens rushed up the slope to the open doors of
the cars.
</p>

<p>
The lounging cowboys sprang to life.  Throwing
themselves in excited abandon on their
bronchos behind the station, they tore across
the tracks and disappeared in the folds of the
prairie, shouting, cracking their quirts, laughing
taunts at each other, to reappear a few minutes
later, little less noisy, behind a small herd of
galloping cattle headed for the emptying outer
stockades.
</p>

<p>
It was a scene of blazing life and colour,
clamorous, swift, kaleidoscopic.  Stamford's
eyes blazed.  The East seemed such a dull
spot in his past.  He thought with a cynical
smile of how unfitted he was, by nature and
acquirement, for a life so deliciously thrilling.
</p>

<p>
Cockney struck his hands together explosively.
</p>

<p>
"There's good old beef for good old England,
my boy!"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind, Cockney," Stamford
grimaced, "would you give me warning when
you have those thunder-claps in mind?  You
jar me out of focus, mentally and optically....
I wish we had some of that 'good old beef'
down at my hotel.  I often wonder where the
West gets the beef it eats."
</p>

<p>
"Get a herd of your own, man.  I didn't
know as much about ranching when I started
as you do.  There's a million miles of grazing
land out about the Red Deer yet."
</p>

<p>
Stamford made a wry smile.  He drew out
the large purse and counted three dollar bills
and sixty cents in silver.
</p>

<p>
"Would that start me?" he asked.  "Guess
I'd have to steal the herd."
</p>

<p>
"Lots have done that before you," said
Cockney, staring over the prairie.
</p>

<p>
A loose-limbed cowboy, whose chaps seemed
to be about to slip over his hips, had
drifted over from the stockades as they
talked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he exclaimed, slapping Cockney on
the back, "good old beef for England, and good
old gold for you!"
</p>

<p>
The jeer in the tone might have passed,
Stamford felt sure, but the slap on the back was
another matter.  He understood Englishmen
rather well, Aikens in particular, and he knew
that even the King would require a winning
smile to gild such familiarity.
</p>

<p>
Aikens stiffened.
</p>

<p>
"Once or twice, Dakota," he warned quietly.
"I've <i>looked</i> what I thought of this particular
form of playfulness; now I've <i>told</i> you.  The
natural progression is the laying on of
hands&mdash;and that'll come next."  He turned his
back.
</p>

<p>
Dakota Fraley, foreman of the H-Lazy Z
and part owner, tried to laugh it away, but he
did not move.
</p>

<p>
Stamford was apparently absorbed in the
procession of steers up the gangways.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they a bit thin, Cockney?  A month
or two more on the ranges would have rounded
them out a bit, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"There are thousands more out there getting
the extra month or two," returned Cockney,
with an expansive gesture.
</p>

<p>
Dakota laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody musta told him," he said to
Stamford.  "He don't see the herds twice a
year."
</p>

<p>
"Why should I?" demanded Aikens lightly.
"You know all about them.  Why do you
think I gave you a share in the H-Lazy Z?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford was unnecessarily embarrassed at
the scene.  He knew about both men what
was generally known.  Cockney Aikens was
a good-natured, irresponsible fellow, completely
ignorant of ranching and as little concerned
to learn, quick of temper as of smile, with an
unfortunate passion for gambling and a reckless
thirst that was sullying his reputation.  Dakota
Fraley was a cowboy, by instincts and training,
with the untypical addition of a reputation
as a "bad actor."  Though there was nothing
more definitely disreputable known about him
than unconcealed disregard for law and order,
a few instances of cynical brutality made even
ranchers sometimes forget what a profitable
enterprise he had made of the H-Lazy Z.
</p>

<p>
The association of the two men was inexplicable,
except for the fact that Aikens, arriving
four years earlier from none knew where, with
no qualifications for a rancher but the money
to start a herd, was just the sort of tenderfoot
to swallow Dakota holus-bolus as part of the
operation&mdash;and then to sit back with the
conviction that he had done his share.
</p>

<p>
A few, including the Mounted Police, knew
something of Dakota's past, but in a country
where a man's present is all that matters, the
story that might have been told died from
lack of interest.  In a general way it was
common knowledge that Dakota had drifted
over from the States, a born cow-puncher,
broncho-buster, and prairie-man; and at his
heels had come a motley assortment of kindred
spirits whom Dakota had rounded up as his
outfit at the H-Lazy Z.  No one could say that
the results in cold cash had not justified him.
</p>

<p>
Dakota stood flipping his quirt against his
chaps, a slight frown on his forehead but a
forced smirk on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>is</i> early," he explained to Stamford,
"but the prices is good now&mdash;good enough
to pay to ship.  They'll come down, shore
thing&mdash;and it saves in outfit, thinning out
the herds."
</p>

<p>
"If that gang of toughs we keep about the
H-Lazy Z aren't enough to handle twice our
herds," observed Cockney, "then I know
nothing about ranching."
</p>

<p>
"You've shore said it right that time, boss,"
jeered Dakota.  "You don't."
</p>

<p>
"We've the biggest outfit on the Red Deer."
</p>

<p>
Dakota faced him squarely with angry eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Say, who's running that end of the H-Lazy Z?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney's head turned slowly, and Dakota
decided to modify tone and language.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't I getting result?  That's all that
counts, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
All Stamford's experience warned him that
they would be at each other's throats in a
moment, but his Western life had been too
limited to allow for the greater licence where
emotions crowd so close to the surface.
</p>

<p>
He was relieved when both men turned
toward the dusty black trail down the grade
to Medicine Hat, from which came the soft
pad of a cantering horse.
</p>

<p>
A stodgy little broncho was loping easily
along, a woman seated astride its broad back.
At such a distance Stamford's only impression
was of a perfect equestrienne, mingled with
some surprise that a woman should appear
in such a scene.  Then he became aware of
her perfect physique, an overflowing vitality,
and an intense pleasure in the very act of riding.
It attracted him strangely, for modesty of
stature had all his life imposed an undue
modesty of manner in his relationship with
the other sex.  The uncouth shouts of the
cowboys, the rumbling trample of the cattle
up the gangways and in the sand-strewn cars,
the threatened explosion of the past minute,
sank into the background of his mind as he
watched.
</p>

<p>
The longer the silence in his little group,
the more the approaching woman looked to
him like a studio arrangement that must
utterly fail, in the incongruity of its essential
parts, to melt into a natural picture.  It was
impossible to fit her into that background of
untilled hills, dead grass, barren waste, though
there could never be awkwardness where she
was concerned.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens raised his head with a jerk
and stared, frowning in a puzzled way.
</p>

<p>
Dakota merely glanced at the supple rider
and transferred his eyes to Cockney's lace.
</p>

<p>
"Here's your Yankee, Mr. Aikens," he
grinned, and lounged across the tracks to the
loading pens, laughing as he went.
</p>

<p>
The look on Cockney's face warned Stamford
to silence, but he trotted to the end of the
platform and offered his hand to assist the
woman to alight.  With a quick flick of her
body she stood beside him, rewarding him
with a gentle smile as she rearranged her
skirts.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  Matana will stand by herself."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes had scarcely paused on Stamford
before passing on to the big rancher.  Aikens
had not moved.  With lowered head he was
staring at her.  She stooped in some confusion
and brushed her skirt to smoother lines about
her limbs.  Then her head went up, and with
a nervous laugh she moved swiftly along the
platform.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, what are you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"I got tired waiting out there, Jim," she
pouted.  "It's so lonesome."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was appealing, yet charged with
a nervous independence.  Cockney's reply was
to stare down on her for a few moments, and
turn his back without another word and follow
Dakota to the loading cars.
</p>

<p>
Never had Stamford longed so intensely for
the physique to squeeze an apology from a
bully's throat, but the greater desire to hide
from the hurt wife what he was thinking made
him turn to her with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"These must be trying days to the
shippers&mdash;ah&mdash;Mrs. Aikens, isn't it?  I suppose you've
had breakfast?  I have, I believe, a bit of
chewing gum in my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"I stopped in town for breakfast," she replied
dully, her eyes on the big man climbing lazily
to the roof of one of the cars before the
gangways.  "When I need more I'll go out to our
mess-wagon.  It'll be out there somewhere
with the cattle."
</p>

<p>
"They've just commenced loading," Stamford
went on eagerly.  "This is my first experience.
You see, I'm the sample tenderfoot in
this district.  I believe," he added, with a
whimsical smile, "I've been that ever since I
came."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were on him now, and Stamford
saw a gleaming smile, behind which lay an
ever-gnawing worry.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to enjoy the distinction so well
as to be jealous already of your successor,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"It has its advantages, especially to an editor.
It gives me access to the sources of news&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thrusts them at you, in fact," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I trust my news sense culls out the wheat."
</p>

<p>
"I read the <i>Journal</i>," she told him slyly.
</p>

<p>
"That's the first encouragement I've had
since my arrival.  Might I give such commendation
a fitting place on the front page?"
</p>

<p>
"Since your arrival," she returned lightly,
"the <i>Journal</i> has surely added a new zest to
local existence."
</p>

<p>
He extracted an enormous notebook from a
capacious pocket.
</p>

<p>
"I must make a note of that," he said.  "My
friends will probably be seeking an epitaph for
me shortly.  You see, this week I start to
collect two months' bills.  If I survive that I've
announced my intention of learning to ride&mdash;rather
<i>starting</i> to learn.  If an indulgent Providence
still leaves me on earth, there remains
the fare at the Provincial Hotel to seal my fate.
Any one of the three, I'm told, is enough to
make a man wonder what his friends may select
for his tombstone."
</p>

<p>
Her laugh tinkled spontaneously, so that
Cockney rolled over on his elbow to look at
her, and a couple of cowboys peeped shyly
round the end of the cars and ducked to cover
when they realised they were seen.
</p>

<p>
"A course in ranch-life is what you need,
Mr. Stamford.  It's only a case of nerves.
At the H-Lazy Z, for instance, we have air
that can't be beaten, food that will certainly
sustain&mdash;even salads now and then&mdash;and there
are a million square miles of soft grass to fall
on.  Let the collecting out to someone who
totes a gun."
</p>

<p>
"The suggestion is so good," he replied
solemnly, "that I take it as an invitation.
When the worst threatens, I'll remember the
H-Lazy Z&mdash;and its&mdash;ah&mdash;charming mistress."
</p>

<p>
"Right-o!" she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"That's your husband speaking," he said.
"I suppose living with even an Englishman is
contagious."
</p>

<p>
Her face suddenly went wistful.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she agreed absent-mindedly.
</p>

<p>
Stamford thought he had never before heard
so much in a single innocent word.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
CORPORAL FAIRCLOTH ARRIVES
</h3>

<p>
As the loading fell to a routine it quickened
its pace.  Every seven or eight minutes
the two loaded cars were replaced by
empty ones whose floors had already been
strewn with sand.  When the outer yards
emptied their live freight into the loading pens,
the cowboys whose duty it was galloped off
into the low hills for more.  Sometimes Dakota
Fraley rode with them, but for the most part
he busied himself hastening the loading operations.
</p>

<p>
Brand-Inspector West, small, wiry-haired,
nervous, with worry in his eyes and a
semi-apologetic manner he tried in vain to conceal,
had much to struggle against in the performance
of his duty.  Wherever he got he was in the
way, principally Dakota's.  From the edge
of the gangways near the car doors Dakota
brushed him unceremoniously; on the stockade
fence near the gangways he was a nuisance
to the prodders.  Here and there he darted,
peering through the bars, reaching over the
railing of the gangways, snatching hasty glances
at the jumbled herds in the outer pens, as
inefficient as he was conscientious.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens lounged on the roof of the
loading cars, where he overlooked everything,
moving lazily from car to car as they filled
and were shunted back.  He saw the
bewildered efforts of the brand-inspector, and
his eyes followed Dakota from place to place,
altering their focus sometimes to the pens and
gangways below him.  As the largest shipper,
his foreman, Dakota Fraley, had charge of
the operations, and all but a couple of the
cowboys about the yards were from the H-Lazy Z
outfit.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Aikens and Stamford crossed the tracks
and stationed themselves near the gangways.
</p>

<p>
Many of the cattle were of Texan breed,
their long white horns swaying awkwardly up
the gangways to catch now and then in car
door or fence, momentarily holding up the
line.  The faster the loading moved, the more
disturbing these breaks in the swing of the
work.  A tremendous steer, its horns projecting
over the gangway railing, lumbered up the
slope and paused at the car door, doubting
the width of the opening.  At a vicious prod
from Dakota it dashed forward, jammed the
point of one horn in the side of the car, withdrew
it, and in a panic drove the other horn in the
other side.
</p>

<p>
The line behind, a solid mass, jammed
tighter and tighter.  Two cowboys leaped to
Dakota's assistance, but the steer only closed
its eyes to their blows and stood braced.
</p>

<p>
Cockney, looking down at first with some
amusement, saw what was happening back in
the gangway and heaved himself upright.
Dropping to the side of the gangway, he tossed
Dakota and another cowboy to the ground
and reached a hand across to either horn.
Without apparent effort he forced the steer's
head sideways so that its horns ran diagonally
with the opening, and, swinging a leg over
the railing, kicked the brute forward into the
car.
</p>

<p>
Catching Stamford's admiring gaze he paused
only long enough to thrust an unlit cigarette
between his lips, before sidling down the
outside of the railing to the stockade.  There the
brand-inspector had stubbornly installed
himself, refusing to make way for the prodders
and protesting at the speed of the loading.
Cockney, holding to the railing with one hand,
reached across the backs of the cattle and lifted
the little man clear over the gangway, depositing
him laughingly on the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Such a little fellow," he bantered, "yet
so much in the way!"
</p>

<p>
He winked at Stamford and his wife.
</p>

<p>
West exploded in a typical volley of Western
oaths.  Cockney waved a finger at him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fie, West!  And before ladies!  Mary,
that's not part of his duties.  It's only an
accomplishment that has gained him more
notoriety than his official capacity.  He wants
to give the impression of guarding the Great
West from cattle-thieving and rustling."  He
pointed to West's flaming face.  "That's not
anger.  West never gets mad.  It's shame at
losing control before ladies."
</p>

<p>
West's hat came off with a sweeping bow
to Mrs. Aikens.
</p>

<p>
"We don't expect ladies at these little affairs,"
he apologised.  "At the same time"&mdash;turning
to Cockney&mdash;"I must insist on being permitted
to do my duty&mdash;else I'll order the loading
to stop."
</p>

<p>
Dakota came blustering under the gangway.
</p>

<p>
"West's got his job to do, Mr. Aikens.  Let
him alone."
</p>

<p>
Cockney lolled against the railing, looking
with twisted lips down into Dakota's sullen
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I lift him up where he can see
everything, Dakota, and protect him from your
bullying?"
</p>

<p>
Something about it made Dakota's eyes drop.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind him, West," soothed the foreman.
"You come over here and stand on the
fence.  As long as you don't get in the way
about the gangways you're all right."
</p>

<p>
Stamford failed to see how any one on the
fence, except at the gangways, could see more
of the cattle than their backs.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens watched Dakota thoughtfully
as the latter pulled himself to the other
gangway.  Then he climbed to his old perch
on the roof and lay on his elbow without
lighting his cigarette.  And Mary Aikens watched
her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Poor West!" sympathised Stamford.  "He
leads a dog's life.  I can feel for small men."
</p>

<p>
He saw she was not listening.  "I was saying&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I wasn't listening, Mr. Stamford,"
she said apologetically.  "What were you
saying?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe I remember.  I never say
much worth while."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't&mdash;that," she explained uncomfortably.
</p>

<p>
Stamford yielded to her embarrassment.
"West and your husband should change jobs."
</p>

<p>
A gust of laughter broke from her lips.  It
startled him, but he went on:
</p>

<p>
"I don't think Dakota Fraley would stop
Cockney Aikens&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think Dakota was doing it purposely?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford stared.  "I didn't think of that.
Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;  But why should he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," she laughed, "why should he?"
</p>

<p>
"Your husband would make an admirable
brand-inspector, and West's size would be no
handicap to a rancher."
</p>

<p>
"Jim isn't a rancher; he wasn't born with
the first qualification....  I don't believe
that's to his discredit, do you?"
</p>

<p>
She was challenging him with her eyes, facing
him squarely.
</p>

<p>
"Cockney Aikens possesses the greatest
qualification of all," he replied, "&mdash;the capacity
for picking the right man to boss the job&mdash;and
the right woman to make such a job on
the Red Deer endurable."
</p>

<p>
"That is very eastern of you, Mr. Stamford,"
she smiled.  "I have known the social life
that sort of thing springs from."  Her face
went dreamy.  "The right man, you
say&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps he has picked&mdash;the right man.
I suppose&mdash;that is a qualification."
</p>

<p>
Stamford felt constrained once more to
change the subject.
</p>

<p>
From the corner of his eye he saw Cockney
suddenly raise himself and look away to the
hills.  Stamford turned in the same direction.
</p>

<p>
A Mounted Policeman was seated motionless
on his horse on the crest of a rise, looking down
on the station yard.  For only a moment
Cockney looked, then slid from the roof to
the gangway railing, a frown on his handsome
face.  At the same instant Dakota dropped
from the fence surrounding the stockade and
whispered to a companion, and the two
sauntered away round the corner of the cattle
pens.
</p>

<p>
A moment later Cockney sauntered carelessly
after them and peered away into the Saskatoonberry
and bulberry bushes that filled a coulee
extending from close to the tracks.  In long
strides he retraced his steps, crossed the tracks
to his horse behind the station, and loped off
over the prairie toward the herd-filled coulees.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE SHOTS FROM THE BUSHES
</h3>

<p>
Presently the policeman gathered up
his reins and came on, casting his eyes
about him.  While still some distance
away, Stamford recognised Corporal Faircloth,
his favourite in the local Force.
</p>

<p>
Their friendship was closer than the ordinary,
especially in the West.  A couple of months
earlier, within a week of Stamford's arrival,
the tenderfoot had yielded to the tug of the
clear prairie evening and launched himself
thoughtlessly on the great stretches of soft
moonlight that looked so brilliant from the
town, but altered every guide where landmarks
were few.  So effectively did he tear himself
from the rude haunts of men that when he
thought of bed he had not the least idea in
which direction to seek it.  It was an early
lesson in the supreme helplessness of being
lost on the prairie.
</p>

<p>
A dim light in the eastern sky was tinging
the moonlight when a Mounted Policeman
came on him seated hopelessly beside the Trail.
Corporal Faircloth was riding in through the
night from Medicine Lodge.  From that meeting
had sprung a friendship that helped to fill a
want that now and then oppressed the editor
in the unconventional and thoughtless friendships
of the prairie.  What a bearing the new
companionship would have on his future never
entered his head.
</p>

<p>
Now the Corporal rode slowly along the
side of the stockades, staring into the four
filled yards, and jogged across the track to
leave his horse with the others.  Returning
on foot, he stopped a moment to greet the
two spectators before mounting the gangways.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes he stood on the fence,
moving from gangway to gangway, making
way for the cowboys in their work, but always
keeping the operations under his eye.  The
brand-inspector studied him with covert envy,
as the Corporal climbed along the outside
of a gangway and placed himself close to one
of the car doors.  At intervals he strained
forward to examine a passing steer, and for
an obviously unsatisfied two minutes he lay
at length on the roof, head extended over the
gangway.
</p>

<p>
All the time Mary Aikens' eyes followed
him as they had her husband a few minutes
before.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he dropped to the ground and hurried
to the stockade fence.  For what seemed
hours to Stamford's rioting imagination he
peered through the heavy rails, restrained
excitement in every move.  A couple of
cowboys moved away, conversing in whispers.
</p>

<p>
With equally sudden purpose the Policeman
climbed the fence, at the same time shouting
to West, who, having found a post from which
he had not been ousted for five minutes, obeyed
reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
At that moment two rifle shots snapped
from the shrub-filled coulee.
</p>

<p>
Corporal Faircloth straightened up on the
fence, and dropped limply outside the pens.
</p>

<p>
Instantly every cowboy sank to cover,
reaching for his gun.  Only little
Brand-Inspector West scorned danger.  He leaped
across to the fallen Policeman and raised his
head.
</p>

<p>
The thing had happened so suddenly that
Stamford was too bewildered to move, until
the woman at his side dashed beneath the gangways
to West's assistance.  Stamford turned and
ran across the tracks to the station telephone.
</p>

<p>
As he reached the platform a third shot cut
the silence that had fallen about the stockades.
Stamford could see the cowboys lying close
to the pens glance anxiously about for trace
of the third mysterious bullet, and then
questioningly to each other.  A pair of
leather-chapped fellows squirmed round the corner,
revolvers poised, and, crouching low, rushed
the shrubbery from which the shots had
come.
</p>

<p>
By the time Stamford was back at the tragic
group Corporal Faircloth's eyes were opening&mdash;such
hopeless eyes.  He smiled up into the
woman's face and seemed suddenly to remember
what had happened.
</p>

<p>
"Tell the Inspector&mdash;stop&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A gush of blood stilled his tongue for ever.
</p>

<p>
Stamford, staring incredulously into the face
of his dead friend, grated his teeth, tears
dropping down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"By God!" he hissed.  "By God!" he
repeated, gripping his fists.  It was as if he
were taking an oath of vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens turned her wet eyes up to
his with a shudder and burst into violent
sobbing.
</p>

<p>
A dozen cowboys, galloping up with the next
herd for the stockades, dashed into the coulee,
Dakota Fraley most eager of all.  Stamford
bent to the body of his murdered friend, and
they carried him mournfully over the tracks
to the station platform.
</p>

<p>
As they laid him down on the rough planks,
his poor blind eyes turned to the sky he had
worked under in every season with the glorious
conscientiousness of the Mounted Police, a
silent group of cowboys, hats in hand, crept
across the tracks, bearing another body.
</p>

<p>
Back in the coulee they had come on him,
one of themselves, Kid Loveridge, of the H-Lazy
Z outfit, shot through the neck.  Only one rifle
had they found&mdash;for they carried rifles only
on special work on the prairie&mdash;and it lay
beside Kid's limp hand, an empty cartridge
near.
</p>

<p>
Round the corner of the stockades Dakota
Fraley dashed, pulling up as the second
procession laid its burden beside the dead body
of the Corporal.  He leaned over and looked
into the bloodless face of his comrade, seemingly
dazed.  Then he bit his lip and shifted his
head, struggling to face down the grief and
horror of it with the grimness fostered in the
life he knew best.
</p>

<p>
"Who did it?" he demanded fiercely.  "Who
murdered the Kid?"
</p>

<p>
His revolver was clenched in his hand,
pointing skyward.  They only looked at him
sadly and sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"The Kid!" he whimpered, his lip trembling.
</p>

<p>
Brand-Inspector West spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Back in that coulee two rifle shots and one
pistol shot.  We've found only one empty
rifle cartridge, a Winchester."
</p>

<p>
That was the problem that faced the Police
when they arrived&mdash;Sergeant Prior and
Constable Woolsey&mdash;riding like mad up the steep
trail from Medicine Hat.  Not five minutes
behind them came Inspector Barker on a light
engine, having commandeered it in the station
yards as a quicker means of transportation,
and as an ambulance for the Corporal, whose
death Stamford had not telephoned.
</p>

<p>
For hours the Policemen ranged the hills,
searching, searching.  If they found any clue
they said nothing of it, but the Inspector's face
was ominously grave.
</p>

<p>
They told their stories, but in the crowding
tragedy of it much was omitted, much of no
consequence included.  Dakota Fraley swore
before them that he himself would find the
murderer of Kid Loveridge, if the Police failed.
</p>

<p>
"The Kid and I," he burst out, "went along
together there just before the shooting to where
we'd left our horses, and there wasn't a blessed
sign of anyone.  The Kid struck back for our
own bunch, and I climbed the rise to join the
drivers.  Nobody out there seemed to hear
the shots, what with the shouting and the
rush of the cattle....  And&mdash;and there's the
Kid!"  His face twisted, ana he struggled to
hide it with a curse.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Barker listened without a word.
</p>

<p>
"Why was Loveridge carrying a rifle?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know he was.  I don't believe it's his."
</p>

<p>
"That's easily proved," said the Inspector.
Dakota said nothing more.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens had ridden in with the
Police from their search.  He reported that
Kid Loveridge had never reached the H-Lazy
Z outfit, of course; but his replies were sullen
and brief, and Inspector Barker did not press
him.  At the end Cockney addressed his wife.
</p>

<p>
"This is less than ever a place for a woman.
Go in to town now.  I'll be spending the night
at the Provincial."
</p>

<p>
She flinched before the tone of command.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather stay here, Jim.  I'm not tired.
I can get enough to eat at the mess-wagon
till you're ready to come with me."
</p>

<p>
"Best go to town, Mrs. Aikens," Dakota
broke in.  "We haven't much to spare out
there.  The boys'll be hungry."
</p>

<p>
She frowned slightly on him, surprised as
much as annoyed.  Cockney, too, was watching
the foreman.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mary," he said.  "I'll be in during
the afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"You shore might as well go too, boss,"
began Dakota.  "There ain't nothing you'd
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mind your own damn business, Dakota!"
Cockney exploded furiously.
</p>

<p>
Stamford, riding back the down trail to
Medicine Hat, was so wrapped in the mystery
of the double murder that he forgot next day
was publication day.  That night his sleep
was broken in the cramped little bedroom
in the Provincial.  When the last form was
on the press and everything ready for the
newsboys and the mailing, he hired again the
unimpeachable horse and good enough buggy
and drove out to Dunmore Junction.
</p>

<p>
The last cars were facing the gangways.  A
cloud of cowboys was clustered about the
stockades, wearily watching the thinning lines
move up the gangways, their desultory conversation
constantly reverting to the tragedies of
the previous day.  A thousand times they
had reviewed and discussed every phase of it,
but the excitement still clung.
</p>

<p>
Dakota Fraley, raw of temper and untidier
than ever, was making notes.  With a sigh
of relief he snapped the notebook shut and
looked out over the prairie.  From the low
hills was streaming down a line of rocking
wagons, their drivers lashing the horses and
shouting defiance at each other.
</p>

<p>
The ranchers from the Red Deer were grouped
at one gangway comparing notes&mdash;all except
Cockney Aikens, who was lolling on a station
bench, smoking hard, speaking to no one.  He
seemed to have aged during the night; in his
eyes was a gaunt, wild look, and his clothes
were seedy.  Stamford read the record of one
man's night in town.
</p>

<p>
The wagons rattled up.  Dakota singled one
out, stopped it with a peremptory wave, and
engaged the driver in low conversation.
Stamford moved carelessly nearer.  The driver was
expostulating, pleading&mdash;Dakota obdurate.
</p>

<p>
"You'll take the north trail right here, see?"
he jerked, pointing to where a dim break in
the dead grass announced the direct trail to
the Red Deer, avoiding the town.
</p>

<p>
"An' ain't I to have no time in town?"
whined the driver.  "It ain't my fault
that&mdash;&mdash;"  His voice sank away.
</p>

<p>
"You've had two nights of it already.  Now
git that wagon away as fast as you know how."
</p>

<p>
The last picture in Stamford's mind of the
Red Deer shipping was a stream of swaying
wagons rattling down the deep trail to town
to the cheers and whip-cracking of their drivers.
And off to the north one lone wagon rolled
silently and slowly northward over the dead
grass toward the lonely stretches of the Red
Deer.  And Stamford wondered.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
DAKOTA RUNS AMOK
</h3>

<p>
Cattle shipping, as any other event
that collected cowboys, was a time of
some anxiety in Medicine Hat.  Stores
closed early, citizens with any claim to being
old-timers&mdash;and that was the leading ambition
locally&mdash;retired unobtrusively to their homes, and
even the bars, which stood to profit materially
from the visit of lively young bloods whose
veins had been swelling for months without
outlet&mdash;or inlet&mdash;contemplated the occasion with
misgiving amounting almost to trepidation.
</p>

<p>
The daily life of the West in those days,
especially the part of it that dealt with law
enforcement, was sufficient training in itself
to arouse something like indifference to ordinary
perils.  Still, everything considered, it was well
not to be associated with the maintenance of
peace when broad-brimmed sombreros and
sheepskin, angora, or leather chaps careered
down Main or Toronto Streets on bronchos
that seemed as appreciative of the excitement
as their riders themselves.
</p>

<p>
At such time it was no matter of regret
among the Mounted Police that the policing
of incorporated towns in the Canadian West
was in an equivocal position to which they
bowed.  According to the strict interpretation
of the law, the jurisdiction of the Mounted
Police was without geographical limits within
the prairie provinces; but no town policeman
would admit that such a reading was not
blind prejudice.  Thus it came to pass, to
avoid endless squabbling and overlapping, that
the red-coats confined their attention to the
great stretches where man was seldom seen
breaking the law&mdash;until such time as the town
police, in shamefaced recognition of their physical
limitations, called in their better known brethren.
</p>

<p>
When the cowboys ran amok in town, he
was a tenderfoot red-coat who envied the town
policeman his monopoly.
</p>

<p>
There is little inherently bad about the
cowboy.  Normally he is fairer, more gallant
and honest than the ruck of Westerners who
have gone West with their eyes blinded by
dollars.  Often a shocking cold-bloodedness
marks his revenge or anger, but it is usually
frank and fair, according to his lights, a
development of the hard life he lives.
</p>

<p>
Out there on the prairie no house is locked.
There, where the nearest neighbour may be
hours of hard riding distant, no decent woman
need be afraid.
</p>

<p>
But lope the same gallant, honest cowboys
into town in a group of a fine evening, and it
is best to be where they aren't.  To them town
is the visible epitome of all they contemn:
luxury, inexperience, flaccidity, nervousness;
the source of that impending peril, the farmer.
Town has its uses, the admissible ones being
the amusement and accommodation of visiting
ranchers and their outfits.
</p>

<p>
And one of the readiest amusements, and
usually the cheapest, is impressing the townsman.
</p>

<p>
Dakota Fraley and his gang were peculiarly
trained to enjoy this form of amusement.
Over in Montana, where they came from, the
law was less confining&mdash;a mere matter of solitary
sheriffs, probably recruited from among
themselves after the excitement of punching palled.
This side of the border it was more relentless,
depending upon straight-shooting, fearless,
hardriding, uniformed officials who scorned the
assistance of posses and were only the human
representatives of an overwhelming force that
could not be stayed by a thousand rifles or
reputations.  To have a chance to break loose
in such a tight-laced country was like rolling
out a pent-up oath when the parson's back
is turned.
</p>

<p>
Dakota and his mates hated Canada, as a
burglar hates an electric alarm, because a
flesh-and-blood gunman hadn't a chance.  They
hated the townsman especially because of his
insulting confidence in the protection of the
law.
</p>

<p>
Most of all they hated the Mounted Police.
</p>

<p>
When the last steer had lumbered up the
gangway and been locked in the last car, Dakota
and his companions lingered on the trail to
town.  They knew their unpopularity with
the other outfits and resented it.  The Mounted
Police knew, in the course of their intimate
investigations into the past of everyone who
ever came West, that this feeling was no novelty
to Dakota's comrades.  They were almost as
unpopular in their own country.  Indeed, under
adequate pressure Inspector Barker might have
told an interesting story of the reason for
Dakota's change of climate.
</p>

<p>
On South Railway Street the H-Lazy Z
outfit pulled up.  Here were the most bars,
and since these were crowded they split into
small groups and divided their patronage.  The
Royal, the Commercial, the European, the
Cosmopolitan were treated impartially, for they
all served equally potent liquid.  Disregardful
of toes and elbows and prior rights, they dived
into the crowds and for fifteen minutes kept
the perspiring dope-slingers busy on recklessly
juggled concoctions.
</p>

<p>
From Inspector Barker's window across the
tracks four Mounted Policemen sighed; they
read the story of the night ahead, without being
within sight of the labels on the bottles.
</p>

<p>
After that a breathing space of ominous
quiet, for the cowboys were gorgeously hungry
after two days of mess-wagon fare.
</p>

<p>
Every hotel in town was prepared, though
they had nothing to fear but hunger.  Not one
of the cowboys was likely to impose in the
dining-room.  They might, within the last two
minutes, have been shooting up the town,
filling themselves on rot-gut, cursing each
other and everything else with fraternal abandon
or fighting with the ruthlessness of fiends.  In
the dining-room they became more formal
than the freshest "remittance-man" from
"back home."  They might hanker to seize
their soup plates and gulp the contents into
impatient throats, but they genteelly spooned
it up, tilting it daintily to the last drop.  They
might tackle poached eggs with a knife, but
they contemplated their comparative failure
with gravity and patience.  They never smiled
or spoke above a whisper; and before they
appeared at the table each and every one had
stood in line in the hotel lavatory for a turn
at the common brush and comb&mdash;unchained,
because there was no danger of theft.
</p>

<p>
As befitted his rank, Dakota selected the
Provincial, taking with him his crony, Alkali
Sam.  They would meet the others in the
market-place after "dinner"&mdash;for the Provincial
alone, run by a venturesome and popular
Englishman, insisted on that untimely
designation for its night meal.
</p>

<p>
Having introduced to their plated interiors
all the liquid refreshment the remainder of
the evening's entertainment could handle with
steady aim, they recalled the assignation.
Thither they repaired, solemnly studying legs
and hands to verify their good judgment,
nevertheless exhilarated by anticipation.
</p>

<p>
In the market-place Bean Slade, Muck
Norsley, General Jones, the Dude, and a few
lesser lights of the H-Lazy Z outfit, together
with kindred spirits from other ranches, were
impatiently cursing the wasted time, with the
bars still open and their thirst unquenched.
When the foreman arrived they cursed him
and his companion with unaffected impartiality,
tightened the cinches, rubbed the noses of
their mounts, and climbed to the saddles.
</p>

<p>
When they dashed through the narrow exit
to Toronto Street the fun was on.
</p>

<p>
Dakota struck straight for the Provincial
opposite&mdash;a brilliant idea that staggered them
all.
</p>

<p>
Now, the front door of the Provincial was
attainable only by climbing fourteen steep steps
and crossing a deep verandah.  The height
enabled loungers to expectorate in comfort
over the railing to the sidewalk without
inconveniencing themselves, and to some extent
discouraged the visits of the too heavily loaded,
who naturally gravitated to the more accessible
bar door, situated lower down the street and on
the street level.
</p>

<p>
Those fourteen steps had acquired a reputation
that subdued the wildest spirits&mdash;like a Mounted
Policeman's uniform.  But one of Dakota's
favourite amusements back in Montana&mdash;a
stereotyped one in a cow country&mdash;was to ride
through the saloon doors.  To-night he was
in the precise humour for shocking convention.
Accordingly eight confirmed loungers were much
scandalised by the nose of Dakota's horse
thrusting itself in their midst.
</p>

<p>
Judas&mdash;Dakota's own name for his mount,
because, as he said, you never know when he's
going to sell you&mdash;lowered his head in response
to the swift lash of Dakota's quirt, fixed his
eyes on the centre step of the flight and ate
up the climb in two leaps, drawing up with a
slide as nose and neck protruded through the
front door.  Thereupon Dakota gently urged
him into the rotunda, dodging the chandelier,
and pulled up before the dining-room door,
where he leaned forward, Stetson in hand, to
see what the diners were making of it.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat subdued by the simplicity of the
proceeding and the loneliness of the adventure,
he lay back on Judas' rump to negotiate the
descent, and a bit shamefacedly rejoined his
companions in the street.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was to cover his embarrassment
that he opened the night's performance without
loss of time.
</p>

<p>
Whirling Judas on his hind legs, he dashed
spurs into him and roared down Toronto Street,
shooting into the air as he went, with eight or
ten shrieking, shooting companions behind him.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of South Railway Street the
gas-lamp caught his eye.  A quick shot
scattered the globe, but Medicine Hat's gas,
that gushed from an unlimited sea of natural
supply six hundred feet down in the earth,
continued to blink at him from an undamaged
mantle.
</p>

<p>
"Thunder!" he snorted.  "I must be drunk."
</p>

<p>
The next shot re-established his self-confidence.
</p>

<p>
Someone beside him banged a bullet through
the transom of a store entrance, another brought
down fragments of a telephone insulator, and
two or three, catching sight of an open window,
imprinted their valentines on the ceiling
beyond.
</p>

<p>
Every door was closed and bolted, not for
fear of looting&mdash;no cowboy would stoop to
that&mdash;but in instinctive exclusion of lawlessness.
So that the few caught on the street had no
way of escape.  Dakota recognised it first.
Two or three well-directed shots into the
pavement about their feet invariably drove
pedestrians back against the wall, hands raised,
a mere act of polite acceptance of the fact that
the cowboys owned the town.
</p>

<p>
Two women scurried in a panic for a locked
door, screamed, and turned blanched faces to
the terror.  Dakota raised his arm, shouted,
and on the instant every mouth closed, every
finger was held.  With doffed Stetsons, guns
pointing to the sky, a band of dare-devil
cow-punchers trotted meekly past the terrified
women, bowing as they went, and twenty
yards beyond broke loose with redoubled vigour.
</p>

<p>
At the corner of Main Street every eye flicked
across the tracks to the barracks, but things
seemed lifeless there.
</p>

<p>
Up a deserted Main Street they blazed their
way.  A couple of small store windows "holed"
before them, one, struck at an angle, falling
to pieces.  More gas lights went dark.
</p>

<p>
Morton Stamford, busy in his scrubby little
office on the weekly accounts of publication
day, heard the shooting and threw up his window
to watch the cowboys thunder past.  When
Dakota whirled in his saddle and sent a bullet
on either side of his head, Stamford cudgelled
his panicky brain for a reasonable and dignified
excuse for retirement from the limelight.
Failing to find one, he stuck there, with his head
through the window.  After the clamour had
passed on into Main Street he carefully traced
the bullets through the partition to the outer
office and tried to hoke them as souvenirs from
the brick wall with a paper knife.  Then he
tiptoed to the window and, standing well back,
pulled it down and locked it, though by that
time the shooting had dimmed away.
</p>

<p>
Thrilled with the incident, Stamford hastily
planned a letter to an old newspaper friend
down East who could make use of vivid little
bits like that, with sundry touches of imagination
that would be certain to rouse an Eastern
outcry.  He could draw pictures like that any
time he wanted, and his friends back East had
long since decided that he was either a fool or a
hero.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he remembered that he had not
dined.  It was then he became aware of a
revival of the clamour in another direction.
And as it did not seem to be coming to him,
he went out to it.  On Toronto Street he stood
for a minute to locate the disturbance, but,
hunger getting the better of his curiosity, he
began to trot toward the Provincial Hotel.
</p>

<p>
Round the corner above him careened the
cowboys into Toronto Street, now lifeless
save for the little figure of Morton Stamford
hurrying to dinner.
</p>

<p>
Dakota saw him.  It was nothing short of
insult, this indifferent little tenderfoot waggling
his legs down the street before them.  Stamford
was only half way to safety when Dakota
whirled up behind him on the sidewalk and,
expecting him to duck to the shelter of a
doorway, wheeled off to one side only in time to
escape riding him down.  Judas' sides brushed
Stamford's shoulder, so near a thing was it
for the editor.
</p>

<p>
In a flash Dakota was around, and three
shots in quick succession close to Stamford's
feet were sufficient to warn any but the rankest
tenderfoot what was expected of him.  A
fourth removed his stiff hat.  The next struck
the edge of his boot sole.  Something told
him he was dangerously unconventional.  He
looked up with a smile into the faces of the
crowding cowboys.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to like me, Dakota."
</p>

<p>
"Like you, you little sawed-off!  Never
paid so much 'tention to a tenderfoot in my
born days afore.  I fair love you.  Same time,
I'd like to see you back again that wall and
h'ist your hands.  These is our streets to-night."
</p>

<p>
Stamford continued to grin about him.
</p>

<p>
"I was just on my way to dinner, Dakota,"
he said, and stooped to pick up his hat.
</p>

<p>
"You won't need any&mdash;ever!" yelled Dakota
furiously, reaching for his second gun.
</p>

<p>
But certain slow processes in the brain of
the solitary town policeman had evolved the
decision that the town's peace was being
breached at last.  From the shadow of an
adjacent doorway he stepped and seized Judas'
bridle.
</p>

<p>
"Stop it, Dakota!  You get right away home.
There's a good-sized bill against you already.
There'll be another not so easy to pay if you
don't vamoose."
</p>

<p>
But Dakota's anger was riding the crest of
his liberal potations; and anyway this was
only the town policeman.  Clubbing his gun,
he leaned over Judas' neck and struck.  As
he did so, he was bumped into on the off side
and in the effort to retain his seat the gun
dropped to the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
"Cut that out, Dakota, you tarnation ijut!"
growled Bean Slade.  "This ain't no
skull-crackin' holiday.  Neither it ain't Montany.
Not by a damn sight!" he added, with sudden
excitement, pointing down the street with his
quirt.
</p>

<p>
Round the corner from South Railway Street
four Mounted Police were riding nonchalantly.
</p>

<p>
Dakota looked from the red town-uniforms
of the Police to the little figure hurrying up
the Provincial steps.  But the sudden burst
of life behind him decided him for discretion.
Up the street, faster than they had ridden in
their orgy, a group of satisfied cowboys tore.
</p>

<p>
Medicine Hat reopened its windows.  The
loungers reappeared on the Provincial verandah.
Evening strollers returned to the streets.
Inspector Barker locked his office door and went
home to a tardy supper.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Three days later a khaki-coated Policeman
loped up to the cook-house door of the H-Lazy
Z, stooped to look inside, and spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Dakota, I want you."
</p>

<p>
Six cowpunchers gasped.  Dakota opened his
mouth and closed it without speaking, but his
face reddened.
</p>

<p>
"Come here!"
</p>

<p>
Dakota stumbled to his feet and came to
the doorway.  Constable Hughes handed him
a blue paper and waited for the reading.
Dakota's anger flamed.  With an oath he tore the
paper in two&mdash;but as the two parts separated,
his hands stayed.
</p>

<p>
"Now you're coming with me, Dakota Fraley!"
</p>

<p>
The Policeman dismounted without haste
and stepped up to the part-owner of the best
paying ranch in the Medicine Hat district, the
boss of the toughest outfit of cowpunchers in
Western Canada.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is one h&mdash;l of a country!"
growled Dakota, putting on his Stetson and
starting for the stables.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>might</i> be," said Hughes.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
STAMFORD MAKES A DECISION
</h3>

<p>
Morton Stamford sat in his office
staring at a blank sheet of copy
paper.  Already he was an hour
behind his schedule for the day, and the
compositors upstairs had sent down twice for
copy.  According to schedule this was his
morning for preparing the week's editorials,
but, though the town bell would announce
noon in less than half an hour, he had not yet
written a word.
</p>

<p>
What he should like to say he dare not.  A
certain diffidence, impelled by his Western
experiences, held his pen from an attack on
the Mounted Police.  Back East as a
newspaperman he had worked in so closely with
the local police that he knew their every move
in the development of their cases.  Yet in the
ten days since the murder of his friend,
Corporal Faircloth, the Mounted Police seemed
to have done nothing.  Stamford knew of no
clue, no sleuthing, and only vague suspicions.
As a dignified newspaperman there was deep
within him an instinct that he should, therefore,
accept it as evidence of official inertia.
</p>

<p>
As a newspaperman, too, he had struggled
to arrive at definite deductions as to the
murderer, only to be confronted with a blank
wall that drove him to the beginning again to
reconstruct his case.  It was the dead body
of Kid Loveridge that upset all his calculations.
The Kid's reputation was more along the line
of proving him a murderer than the murdered,
and that there was any connection between
the Corporal and one of the wildest cowboys
in Western Canada was impossible.
</p>

<p>
Hitting in and out of his conjectures were
the forms of Cockney Aikens and Dakota
Fraley, two men apparently as antagonistic in
inclinations as they were intimate in business
interests.  Cockney's careless, good-natured
ways appealed to him in a way that denied
belief in inherent badness.  Yet he had gathered
the impression during the Police investigations
on the spot that the big Englishman was not
outside their suspicions.  He resented that.
Cockney was a friend of his.  If the Police
were working on that line he was prepared to
stake&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
His ruminations were interrupted by the
opening of the door to the outer office, and the
clumsy tramp of a heavy man.  For a moment
he waited for the familiar tap on his own door.
All Medicine Hat knew where to find him.
Not hearing the expected summons, he went out.
</p>

<p>
A great hulk of a stranger was standing in the
middle of the office, feet braced, peering about
him through large horn spectacles.  His
shoulders were stooped, his hands limp and
awkward, his whole attitude and appearance more
than hinting at anæmia and flabbiness.  On
his long black hair was perched a ludicrously
small stiff hat; and he wore a high white collar
and loose black bow tie, a suit built in a factory,
and a pair of "health" boots that could not
possibly possess any other attraction.
</p>

<p>
He seemed entirely oblivious of Stamford's
presence, continuing to stare about at the untidy
arrangement of tables and chairs, and over
the partition that separated the office from the
"job" room.  He was interested; also he
was accustomed to concentrating.
</p>

<p>
Stamford wanted most to laugh.  The fellow
filled the office with such an air of innocent
curiosity that he felt no resentment at his own
small share in the scene.
</p>

<p>
Someone laughed from the doorway, and
Stamford started.  It was such a merry, chuckling
sort of laugh, so much in line with just
the feeling Stamford himself had, that, though
the laugh was a woman's, he vaguely thought
of some uncanny echo that repeated what
was in his mind.
</p>

<p>
When he turned to the doorway he was more
doubtful than ever of the reality of the scene.
A girl stood there&mdash;a beautiful girl&mdash;Stamford
realised that first of all.  Under her soft felt
hat, with a sprig of flowers slanting nattily up
toward the back, a fluffy bit of dark brown
hair protruded.  Stamford saw that next.  He
had a curious feeling that it would be nice to
touch&mdash;and he flushed at the entrance of such
unaccustomed thoughts.
</p>

<p>
She was looking at him, quizzically, still
laughing.  One little step forward she took.
</p>

<p>
"Amos," she said, and in the tone was the
indulgence of a mother, though the man was
years her senior, "Amos, don't you think you
two had better meet?  This is my brother
Professor Amos Bulkeley, of the Smithsonian
Institute," she said, turning to Stamford.
</p>

<p>
Her brother swept his big frame about with
the cheeriest of smiles and extended his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You're the local editor, I suppose," he
said, in a gentle voice.  "We've come to you
for help&mdash;naturally.  Appealing to a newspaper
for help is a habit we all have, from politicians
up to ordinary burglars."
</p>

<p>
"So long as you're not collecting," grinned
Stamford, "my resources are at your command.
My week's accounts show that last week my
charity expenses were seven dollars and twenty-five
cents.  To date that's about my net income
per week."
</p>

<p>
"It's only information we're collecting,"
explained the girl.  "We&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me, dear."  Her brother stopped
her sternly.  "You haven't yet met
Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Morton Stamford," said the editor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stamford, my dear.  Mr. Stamford,
this is my sister Isabel, as yet possessing the
same ultimate name as myself.  But there's
still hope."
</p>

<p>
"I'm certain of it," murmured Stamford
over her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ahem!" said the Professor.  "That's not
starting badly."
</p>

<p>
"If you imply by that that we're to see more
of each other&mdash;&mdash;" began Stamford gallantly&mdash;and
went crimson with wonder at the strange
things his tongue was saying.
</p>

<p>
"Ahem again!" said the Professor slyly.
"Isabel, I have always thought, has such a
strange effect&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure Mr. Stamford has other uses for
his time, Amos, and so have we."  Isabel
Bulkeley was blushing a little herself.
</p>

<p>
"I forgot," apologised the Professor.  "This
is strictly business.  I'm here&mdash;<i>we</i>'re here in
the interests of the Smithsonian Institute.
You may not suspect it, but you have history
embedded in you&mdash;in the form of fossils that
should have disappeared when your
much-removed grandpa was scuttling through the
tree-tops by his tail.  I'm in hopes that the
geanticlinal discoveries of my predecessors
among the argillaceous cliffs of the Red Deer
River will support my contention that somewhere
the course of the river to the north of
you may yield up the secrets of the Triassic,
or at least the Jurassic stage of the Mesozoic
period.  Perhaps the Palæozoic.  Who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"I confess <i>I</i> don't," said Stamford.  "In
fact, except that you seem to be using the
language my mother taught me, I wouldn't
know what you're talking about, were it not
that I happen to be aware of the palæontological
discoveries on the Red Deer.  But that was
three hundred miles west of here."
</p>

<p>
"I'm anxious to get beyond their tracks,"
said the Professor.  "It was the New York
fellows worked there&mdash;our deadly rivals.  I
contend that the Red Deer River did not in
those days boast of circumscribed summer
resorts.  Why, a megatherium could lunch
at Red Deer town and dine in Medicine Hat&mdash;at
least the one <i>I</i> want to find could."
</p>

<p>
"And how can I help you?" asked Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"We don't know a thing&mdash;how we get there,
where we can stay, what we can do."
</p>

<p>
"At last," sighed Stamford, "there's a
tenderer tenderfoot than myself.  For two
long months I've been the baby of the Western
family.  Now I'm ousted from the cradle."
</p>

<p>
The Professor examined his own huge body
doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"How big's this cradle?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It'll hold you and your sister," replied
Stamford gallantly.  "But the man you want
to see is Inspector Barker.  In the West it's
different: you don't consult the newspaper,
but the Mounted Police."
</p>

<p>
He tapped a bell, and the "devil" stumbled
down from the composing-room overhead.
</p>

<p>
"Give these to Arthurs," Stamford ordered,
grabbing a handful of clippings from the
pigeon-hole.  "They'll keep him busy.  I'll be out
for a while.  Watch the office till Smith comes
back."
</p>

<p>
"I'm taking you down to the barracks myself,"
he explained to his visitors.  "The Inspector
might suspect you of ulterior motives.  I
confess," he added whimsically, "that you're
different enough to justify it."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Barker and the editor of the <i>Journal</i>
were on the best of terms.  In Stamford's little
body was all the romance of men physically
unfitted to play a part in the pictures of their
imagination; he had a scalp that tingled
easily.  And the Inspector had experiences
to tell that would tingle any scalp not
fossilised&mdash;as well as little reluctance about clothing
his experiences with what might have happened.
It wasn't often he was free to let himself loose
to such an appreciative audience whose ideas
could expand several sizes in response to a good
yarn.
</p>

<p>
But it was plain enough that Professor Bulkeley
was more susceptible, less inclined to question
the reasonableness of the wildest yarn.
The Inspector received him and his sister with
generous hand, and a smile that took them to
his heart.  And their summer plans only added
to his eagerness.  This was something new in
an extended experience popularly considered
to have covered every possible phase of Western
life.
</p>

<p>
"All the way from Washington, D.C., eh?
Special visit to our benighted town, eh?
Flattered is too mild a word.  Bringing your
sister adds the last drop to our overfull bucket
of gratitude."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," asked the Professor gravely, "did
he put it as nicely as Mr. Stamford, d'ye
think?"
</p>

<p>
The Inspector gurgled into his moustache,
but Stamford was annoyed.
</p>

<p>
"You'll stay at the Double Bar-O," said the
Inspector, getting down to business.  "I think
that'll give you a good centre to work from.
Westward is only the H-Lazy Z.  I don't
think you'd care to stop there.  Cockney Aikens
is a queer fish.  You mightn't understand him."
</p>

<p>
Stamford, in thought, came valiantly to
Cockney's support.  He was certain the Police
had ideas about the big rancher that they did
not care to disclose.
</p>

<p>
"'The Double-Bar-O!'" repeated the
Professor.  "What is it&mdash;a hotel?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford and the Inspector laughed.
</p>

<p>
"A ranch," explained the latter.  "My dear
man, your nearest hotel, when you get to the
Red Deer, is over there on South Railway
Street."
</p>

<p>
"But will they&mdash;will they take us in?"
</p>

<p>
"Professor Bulkeley," said the Inspector
proudly, "this is Western Canada.  You can
lift the latch of any ranch in the country,
any day, any time, and there's a plate and
a bed for you as long as you wish to
remain."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;ah&mdash;the pay?  How much&mdash;about
how much&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The only thing I forgot," interrupted the
Inspector, "is to warn you that your welcome
is limited to the period during which you don't
mention pay."
</p>

<p>
"But we're strangers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's the only excuse for your suggestion.
There are no strangers in the West in that sense
of the word."
</p>

<p>
"So hospitable&mdash;so generous&mdash;so utterly
natural!" beamed the Professor to his sister.
"I suppose there's a livery here&mdash;with a nice
buggy and a gentle horse that I can rent for
two or three months."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Barker stroked his moustache
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"There are liveries&mdash;yes&mdash;but they won't
let you have a horse for that long."  He looked
up suddenly.  "Let me supply you.  I've a
couple of horses out there eating their heads
off.  It's cheaper for us to hire the few times
we need them.  But for goodness' sake, leave
the buggy out.  This is not a country for
driving&mdash;not if you can ride.  But perhaps your
sister&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," declared the Professor proudly,
"is a centauress."  He added with a deprecatory
grin: "I've never been on a horse in
my life."
</p>

<p>
"Amos is going to learn some day," said
Isabel hopefully.  "Aren't you, Amos?  Perhaps
this is his chance&mdash;out on the boundless
prairie."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Bulkeley," Stamford warned, "I
wouldn't speak of the prairie as boundless.
They'll think you're a poetess&mdash;and try to unload
on you a parcel of worthless real estate.  We're
just hungry for people like that out here.  But,"
he added dryly, "I don't believe they'll
succeed."
</p>

<p>
"Is it a compliment, Mr. Stamford?" she asked gaily.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied solemnly, "it's the truth."
</p>

<p>
"How ingenuous!  How simple and sweet
and natural!" gushed the Professor.  And the
little editor bemoaned his lack of inches.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, man, man!" teased the Inspector,
when brother and sister were gone, the
cumbersome Professor passing before the window a
foot behind his quick-stepping sister.  "In
the West it's always Spring.  A country that
hasn't women enough to go round&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What in blazes are you driving at&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think it was in you, Stamford.
I'm delighted to see something of the gallant
again; I thought the West had lost it all these
many years&mdash;or never had it.  The poor Corporal
had traces of it&mdash;&mdash;  Ah!" as Stamford
frowned, "I thought you had something heavier
than a pretty girl on your mind when you
called.  Now, let's have it."
</p>

<p>
Stamford brought his fist down on the desk.
</p>

<p>
"Who murdered Corporal Faircloth?"
</p>

<p>
Inspector Barker readjusted the ink-well.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind, my boy, keep your
thumping for your own desk.  I have this
one reserved."
</p>

<p>
Stamford, stubborn as small men can be,
threw himself into a chair, his hands thrust
deep in his pockets.
</p>

<p>
"In ten days&mdash;what have you done?  That's
what I want to know.  What are you planning
to do?  I'm going to sit here till you tell me."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector frowned, then smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"We close at six.  Those who stay
later&mdash;spend the night in there."  He indicated
the door leading to the cells.
</p>

<p>
Stamford's scowl drifted into a shamefaced
shaking of the head.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to realise that your third
in command was foully murdered, almost under
your very nose!  You don't&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Stamford!  Did you ever hear of
a murdered Mounted Policeman unavenged?
Did you ever know the Mounted Police to
drop the chase&mdash;even for shooting an antelope
out of season?"
</p>

<p>
"But you've done nothing&mdash;nothing."
</p>

<p>
"We don't report to the <i>Journal</i>&mdash;it's not
in the regulations."
</p>

<p>
"And there's Billy Windover," Stamford
stormed on.  "You haven't discovered his
murderer."
</p>

<p>
"Wrap them in the same parcel&mdash;&mdash;"  The
Inspector stopped abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"But I thought you suspected Cockney Aikens."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector turned on him fiercely.  "Who
said we suspected him&mdash;anyone?  Stamford,
Faircloth was your friend; he was not only
my friend for five years but my third in
command for two.  Don't you think you'd better
consult an oculist?  We <i>always</i> suspect&mdash;everyone."
</p>

<p>
"Then why didn't you round up the whole
gang that day?"
</p>

<p>
"Including yourself and Mrs. Aikens,
Inspector West, four ranchers, sixty cowboys&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  Same with the others.  It
isn't always the obvious that explains.  Suppose
we'd arrested Cockney&mdash;or anyone at that time,
where would have been our proof?  We didn't
even find the rifles&mdash;except Kid Loveridge's.
Clues don't grow on bulberry bushes in a
country where everyone can shoot&mdash;and so many
do."
</p>

<p>
Stamford was thinking rapidly.  The repetition
of Cockney's name seemed to confirm his
suspicions of the direction of the Police search.
</p>

<p>
"The thing has got a bit too much for my
nerves&mdash;or something," he declared abruptly.
"I've got to get away from it for a time&mdash;take
a holiday.  In reality it was to tell you
that I came down."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't in the Police regulations, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not, but I wanted you to know
in case&mdash;in case anything happened."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing will happen&mdash;if you mind your
own business."
</p>

<p>
But Stamford did not seem to hear; he was
examining himself in a broken-framed mirror
above the desk.
</p>

<p>
"I need bucking up.  Meals&mdash;change of air&mdash;new
methods and manners&mdash;something doesn't
agree with me.  I can't sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind explaining," grunted the
Inspector.  "I'm not interested in your health.
Here's West now.  I've an appointment with
him."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, West," he said, as the brand-inspector
entered, "the local scribe is enquiring
why we didn't arrest the whole countryside
for Faircloth's murder that day."
</p>

<p>
West smiled in some confusion.
</p>

<p>
The Inspector laughed mirthlessly.  "Yes,
West, you're as critical as he.  But if you&mdash;or
Stamford here&mdash;had given me that day the
details you've remembered since, other things
might have happened."
</p>

<p>
"But I knew&mdash;I saw everything!" stammered
Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"And told so little," snapped the Inspector.
"So many after-thoughts are too late!"
</p>

<p>
He waved Stamford out.  As the editor
passed through the door he turned.
</p>

<p>
"Honest now, Inspector, whom do you suspect?"
</p>

<p>
But the Inspector was already talking to the
brand-inspector.
</p>

<p>
The door closed&mdash;and opened again to admit
Stamford's head.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Inspector, I didn't tell you
where I was going to take my holiday."
</p>

<p>
"You don't need to.  The H-Lazy Z's as
good as anywhere.  Tell the Professor&mdash;if
you see him; the Double Bar-O's only ten
miles away&mdash;that I'm of the opinion that the
schistosity of the stratification in the flexure of
the Cretaceous period exposed thereabouts will
simplify his investigations&mdash;or words to that
effect.  Give my love to his sister."
</p>

<p>
When the door closed again the Inspector
ruminated.  Then he scribbled a message to
the police back at Stamford's Ontario home and
called a constable to despatch it.
</p>

<p>
"West," he said, wheeling suddenly on the
brand-inspector, "you don't happen in your
wanderings to have come across two large dogs
new to the district&mdash;part Russian wolf, part
greyhound, I believe?  A week ago they were
under lock and key in the barracks corral.  One
night they disappeared.  Nobody seems to
have seen or even heard them go&mdash;and they
were wild as wolves, with a howl that would
shame a husky on a Labrador island on a
moonlight night."
</p>

<p>
"Hm-m-m!" grunted the brand-inspector.
"Large tracking dogs in the Police
corral&mdash;deductions obvious."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a hang for deductions.  It's
the dogs I want obvious.  I was depending
on them to run down these measly cattle-thieves
who've been fooling my men all year.  I
thought maybe a good hound or two&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So did the cattle-thieves apparently,"
laughed West.
</p>

<p>
"Therefrom comes one interesting deduction;
the cattle-thieves are local.  But the
stealing is too persistent and small to be otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"And now, I suppose, you'll get another
pair to track the first?"
</p>

<p>
"No-o," replied the Inspector cheerfully.
"It only makes another mystery to solve.  At
one time this looked like being a dull summer."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
AT THE H-LAZY Z
</h3>

<p>
Cockney Aikens was striding up and
down the little gravel walk before the
ranch-house&mdash;the walk that Mary herself
had built from the loose rock of the river-bed&mdash;his
hands thrust deep in his pockets.  Mary,
raising her head sadly from her work to peer
at him through the window, read the symptoms.
So did the cluster of grinning cowboys
from the darkened depths of the cookhouse.
</p>

<p>
Presently Cockney stopped in his stride to
stare off over the valley to the opposite cliff,
his eyes returning slowly to the trail and away
up it toward town, sixty miles away.
</p>

<p>
Muck Norsley, from far back in the cook-house,
looked through the window, watch in
hand.
</p>

<p>
"Yer winning, Gin'ral, o.k.  Jest about
seventeen minutes now, I reckon, and he'll
be saddling&mdash;unless he has to black his boots
and crease his pants."
</p>

<p>
Cockney turned suddenly, kicked two innocent
stones into the grass, and pushed open
the ranch-house door.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, I'm off to town."
</p>

<p>
He spoke roughly.  She lifted the sock she
was darning and set it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"You'll take me this time, won't you, Jim?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you enough here to keep you
busy?"  He would not meet her eyes.  "A
fellow don't want a woman tagging after him
every time he goes to town."
</p>

<p>
"He doesn't have her," she replied with
quiet dignity.
</p>

<p>
She might have told him that one of the
troubles was that she had <i>too much</i> to do about
the H-Lazy Z.  Most of her married life had
been a drudgery, girls refusing to drown
themselves in the isolation of the Red Deer&mdash;sixty
miles from town, without a living soul between,
and the nearest ranch ten miles to the east.
Westward was nothing but wilds for further
than anyone had travelled.
</p>

<p>
A tear squeezed into her eyes.  He saw
her struggling to hold it back, and hastily
retreated outside.
</p>

<p>
The H-Lazy Z ranch may not have been quite
equal to its reputation in a district where not
a dozen citizens had ever visited it, but it
could boast of luxuries&mdash;especially its
ranch-house&mdash;that few other ranches considered worth
the trouble and expense.  This ranch-house
was a two-story structure of numerous and
ample rooms, erected by one with money to
spare and English ideas of expenditure.
</p>

<p>
When Cockney Aikens selected his wife
in a mid-Western American town on one of
the many unreasonable and indefinite trips he
made in those days to distant parts, he insisted
on leaving her at her own home until he had
built for her a residence his uncertain conscience
told him was fit for a woman.
</p>

<p>
In those days Mary Aikens wanted her Jim
more than <i>any</i> house but Cockney was obdurate,
with a stubbornness that hurt her lovesick heart
early in their married life.  He had won her
rapidly, with his big, joyous, reckless ways, and
his pictures of the life in the Canadian West.
With four years to look back on since she left
the Eastern seminary, her little body crammed
with romance, his pictures were all the more
alluring from the monotonous similarity and
repetition of the letters of her late schoolmates,
each of whom, according to her own story, had
captured the one and only sample of real
American manhood.
</p>

<p>
When a girl's friends write month after month
of home magnificence that radiates largely
round the conventional "carriage and pair"
that is the dream of schoolgirls, a whole ranch
of horses and cattle looks like the earmarks
of a fairy prince, especially when they belong
to such a stunning big chap as Jim Aikens.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens often looked back on those days
now with a sad smile.  Jim was still the
stunning big chap&mdash;at times.  At other
times&mdash;&mdash;  But that was the effect of Western haze.  In
the two years of their married life she had never
become really acquainted with her husband.
At the very moment&mdash;it happened again and
again&mdash;when the sympathy she craved was
lifting the latch, Jim Aikens kicked it from the
door with brutal foot and rode madly off on
the southern trail on one of his periodical sprees
in town.
</p>

<p>
The ranch-house stood half way down a long
slope that stretched northward to the Red
Deer River.  A half-mile away, across a valley
that might have been a garden in a wilderness,
rose a sheer line of jagged cliffs, before which
ran the tumbling river.  Up and down the
stream, on both sides of it, sometimes crowding
the current, sometimes set back of a deep valley
filled with weirdly protuberant mounds of rock
from about which the soft clays had been
washed by the rains and currents of ages, the
cliffs were repeated.  Only at long intervals did
the banks slope to the river as they did before
the H-Lazy Z ranch buildings, and that only on
the southern shore.  Elsewhere the Red Deer
rushed through hundreds of miles of a
hundred-and-fifty-foot canyon.
</p>

<p>
Two hundred yards from the house&mdash;Dakota
Fraley had insisted on the distance&mdash;the
cook-house, bunk-house, stables and corrals began,
and spread out over the eastern end of the
valley in conventional disarray, the bottom
corral touching the rough beach that there
lined the river.  Dakota had no stomach for
skirts about the place, especially the kind he
imagined his wild master would bring.  In
that he failed to understand Cockney.
</p>

<p>
Before the ranch-house door Dakota met his
partner retreating from Mary's tears.  Behind
the foreman two or three cowboys lounged in
the open doorway.  Three others rolled off
toward the stables.
</p>

<p>
Cockney stood still, watching them with
lowering eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why the samhill, Dakota, do we need such
a bunch of roughnecks about the place?" he
exploded.  "Every time I see them they make
me think of a gang of Whitechapel foreigners
fresh from Russia, or Hungary, or Poland.  If
they hadn't guns on their hips, there'd be knives
in their bootlegs or stilettos up their sleeves."
</p>

<p>
Dakota laughed in a nasty way.
</p>

<p>
"Best bunch of cowpunchers in Alberta&mdash;in
America, for that matter.  Look at the
ranch they've made for you."
</p>

<p>
Cockney made a wry face.  "Gad!  I could
do without some of the dollars for cheerier
countenances about me.  They look as if they'd
murdered their mothers and were looking for
the rest of the family."
</p>

<p>
"What's it matter to you," Dakota growled,
"so long's they fix you up for your gambling
and boozing?  You better cut butting in on
personnel.  That's <i>my</i> third of the partnership."
</p>

<p>
Cockney was in a vile humour&mdash;that always
came with his craving for town; and his wife's
wet eyes had not improved matters.
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget, Dakota," he said, with deadly
calmness, "it's only a third.  I provided all
the capital."
</p>

<p>
"And don't <i>you</i> forget, <i>Mister</i> Aikens, that
I purvided all the experience&mdash;and I'm still
purviding it, far's anyone can notice&mdash;and all
the work and the worry.  You better go and
get drunk.  We don't need you.  We got <i>real</i>
work to do."
</p>

<p>
Cockney restrained himself.
</p>

<p>
"What are you on now?" he enquired.
</p>

<p>
Dakota's eyes fell.  He turned about and
looked back toward the cook-house.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing special; just the usual rush.
This time it's a lot of riding, looking up a bunch
of mavericks that uv been kicking up the devil.
Missed 'em in the round-up and they've got
chirpy."
</p>

<p>
"You're sure they're ours?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota swung on him angrily.
</p>

<p>
"What the h&mdash;l you mean?  Think I'm
rustling?  <i>Shore</i> they're ours.  They've gone
rampaging down Irvine way with a little bunch
of steers that broke from the nighthawks a
couple of days ago."
</p>

<p>
"Be away long?"
</p>

<p>
"Four or five days, I guess.  You needn't
worry your head.  You couldn't help none."
</p>

<p>
Cockney made no reply, though he winced a
little at the sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Off to town, I see," jeered Dakota.  "Best
place for you&mdash;when you feel that way.  Taking
the missus?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney remained silent, thinking.
</p>

<p>
"Or are you leaving her to us?"
</p>

<p>
Without moving his feet, Cockney's great
fist shot out and caught the side of Dakota's
head.  As his back struck the prairie the
cowboy reached for his gun, but Cockney was
on him with a bound, wrenching one gun from
his hand and another from a loose pocket in
his chaps.  With one hand he lifted Dakota
to his feet and released him.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like the way you speak of my wife,"
he thundered.
</p>

<p>
Dakota, helpless and a little cowed without
his guns, glared his fury.
</p>

<p>
"It's as good as you <i>treat</i> her," he snarled.
</p>

<p>
Cockney started.
</p>

<p>
"She's my wife," he said, with a new dignity.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you was brung up to,
but in this country we'd think that something
to <i>show</i>, not just to talk about."
</p>

<p>
"Don't let me hear you talking about her,"
warned Cockney, "or anyone else," he added,
raising his voice and looking over Dakota's
shoulder to the cook-house.
</p>

<p>
He tossed the guns contemptuously at Dakota's
feet and wheeled about.  The cowboy muttered
oaths at his retreating back, and rubbed the
cords of his neck where the strain of the blow
had come.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens had seen nothing of the incident&mdash;her
eyes were too wet.  With a dead weight
at her heart she sank her head in her arms on
the table and let the tears flow.
</p>

<p>
Cockney came on her that way and softly
retreated, drawing the door gently behind him.
After a few noisy crunches among the gravel
and a preliminary kick to the outside step,
he took a long breath and entered.  She was
darning then, her head held low.  He passed
quickly through to the bedroom door, but
there he stopped, and, without turning, stood
with his hand on the knob.  Then he
disappeared.  Ten minutes later he reappeared
in town attire.
</p>

<p>
In Cockney Aikens' ways were so many
strange conventions that his friends had ceased
to marvel at them.  One of them was the
formality of his dress for his visits to Medicine
Hat.  His boots were soft, light-soled, and
natty, with drab cloth tops, like nothing
ever seen on the prairie before; his socks silken,
with white clocks.  A delicate grey suit enclosed
his huge frame in graceful lines that betrayed
their Bond Street origin.  His collar was a
straight white upstanding affair with delicately
rounded corners, and his cravat Irish poplin
or barathea&mdash;always one of these silks, the
former with a coloured diagonal stripe, the
latter adorned with clusters of flowers.  Above
it all rested a light grey hat.  From his breast
pocket peeped the tips of chamois gloves, and
on one little finger was a curious ring of triple
cameos.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens always gasped when she saw
him thus.  It was thus she had learned to love
him, thus he had turned the heads of half
the girls of the northern United States towns
from Seattle to Duluth.  For Cockney Aikens
wore his clothes as one accustomed to them.
One suit he always kept in town at his tailor's,
pressed and cleaned, changing at each
visit.
</p>

<p>
His wife drew a sharp breath, forgetting
that she was staring at him with uplifted hand.
The evil temper had left his face with his leather
chaps and neckerchief.  He regarded her with
an embarrassed twist to his face.
</p>

<p>
"Better get into your grey," he said, looking
anywhere but into her eyes.  "I'll be ready
for you in fifteen minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim!"
</p>

<p>
That was all.  She dropped her darning on
the table and fled ecstatically to the bedroom.
And big Cockney Aikens picked up the ball
of darning wool and kissed it furtively.
</p>

<p>
By the time he was back from the stables
with a lively team hitched to a buggy, she
was almost dressed, and a suitcase stood packed
outside the bedroom door.  He drew a second
suitcase from beneath the bed and began to
fill it with his ranch clothes.  She watched him,
surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jim, what are you taking those for?"
</p>

<p>
He muttered something about going to do
some riding perhaps, and snapped the catches,
hurrying out with the suitcase to the buggy.
</p>

<p>
Mary bustled to the kitchen and began to
lay various tins on the table.  A side of bacon
she wrapped up and suspended from a hook in
the ceiling.  When she was finished she stood
back and struck off a list on her fingers:
</p>

<p>
"Bacon, flour, cheese, oatmeal, matches&mdash;there,
I forgot the matches again."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, Mary, you're still expecting visitors
to this corner of the moon!"
</p>

<p>
She tilted her head.  "You never know.
We couldn't leave the house with nothing to
eat in it.  Some day&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;  We <i>should</i>
have visitors&mdash;&mdash;"  She ended the sentence
by a noisy clustering of the tins, and ran to
her suitcase.
</p>

<p>
He took it from her hand and carried it out.
One of the horses was trying to get back into
the buggy, but he quieted it with masterful
hand.  With one foot on the step she paused.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;that's Pink Eye!  He's never been
harnessed before, has he?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been breaking him to it.  Good time
to try him out on a long trip like this.  He'll
have the spirit taken out of him in that sixty
miles&mdash;seventy by the Double Bar-O.  We're
going across there first.  Maybe Cherry Gerard
would like to come too; you may be lonesome."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want Cherry, Jim," she pouted.
</p>

<p>
He lifted her in and took his seat beside her
before he replied:
</p>

<p>
"It's possible I'll be leaving you for a couple
of days in there."
</p>

<p>
She was looking straight ahead without a
word of what was in her mind.  But as the
horses galloped madly up the sloping trail to
the east her spirits rose, and she laughed
exultantly.
</p>

<p>
"Seventy miles won't tire Pink Eye," she
gurgled.  "He's steel."
</p>

<p>
Dakota, standing before the door of the
cook-house, watched them go, scorning to reply to
Mary Aikens' waving hand.  It was Bean Slade,
emerging hastily from the interior of the shack,
who returned it, as Pink Eye and his mate tore
along the indistinct eastern trail over the edge
of the prairie above.
</p>

<p>
"Hoorah!" shouted Dakota, when the
moving speck had vanished over the ridge.
</p>

<p>
"Hoorah!" responded a half-dozen voices;
and the Dude and Alkali seized each other for
a musicless dance.
</p>

<p>
"Dassent leave her t'yore tender mercies,
Dakota, ole sport," chaffed Alkali.  "Yo're a
reg'lar lady-killer, that's what yo are."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I dunno," grunted the Dude jealously,
buttoning the loose front of his brilliant vest.
"There's others."
</p>

<p>
"Go 'long with you, Dude," jeered General.
"She never looks at you.  Jest about two days
o' Dakota's slippery manners, and the missus
ud be shore climbing his neck."
</p>

<p>
Bean Slade unwound his lanky legs from a
chair and spat through the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Yer a tarnation liar, Gin'ral.  Not a doggone
neck ud the missus climb that she hadn't
oughter.  An' you're a dang lot o' sap-heads
to talk it."
</p>

<p>
"You oughter know, Bean," grinned General.
"Y'ain't licking her pots fer nothing, I bet."
</p>

<p>
Bean was on his feet so quickly that no one
else had moved by the time a chair whirled
aloft in his hands.  General slid to the cover
of the table in desperate haste.
</p>

<p>
Dakota flung himself between them.
</p>

<p>
"Drop it, you fools!  Nobody's saying nothing
again the missus, Bean.  They're just joshing
you.  You needn't get so touchy anyway;
she ain't <i>your</i> wife."
</p>

<p>
Bean, whose anger rose and fell with disturbing
unexpectedness, dropped the chair.
</p>

<p>
"No sech luck!" he growled.  "If she
was I wudn't risk her where you slimy coyotes
was."
</p>

<p>
Alkali broke in:
</p>

<p>
"And now what's the agendar, Dakota?
Takin' on that Irvine job this week.  'T should
be a good time with the boss away."
</p>

<p>
Dakota screwed his eyes up thoughtfully.
"That's what I had in mind."
</p>

<p>
"No rifles this time," protested Bean Slade.
"We've toted 'em once too often&mdash;I don't
know but <i>twice</i> too often.  Br-r-r!  I won't
ever forget&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut your clap, Bean!  You've had your
man in your day, heaps of 'em."
</p>

<p>
"They allus had their chance," growled
Bean.  "No rifles, I say, or I don't go."
</p>

<p>
Three or four insulting guffaws greeted the
threat.
</p>

<p>
"The Reverend Beanibus Slade, him of
Dead Gulch memory and Two-Shot Dick fame,
will now lead us in singing the twenty-third
Psalm!" scoffed General Jones.  "Come along
with us, Reverend sir&mdash;and bring yore burial
service."
</p>

<p>
"I've said it," repeated Bean stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
Dakota tried to oil the surface.  "We don't
need rifles this time&mdash;it's an easy job....
But we'll shore miss the Kid.  He shore was
the handy kid with the blinkers on a dark night,
and he'd hold a close second to yours truly
with a gun.  Poor Kid!  I'd give my left ear
to get even with the guy that got him.  I've
a bit o' lead resarved for him."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
A LAMB AMONG THE LIONS
</h3>

<p>
"There y'are, mister.  That's your place."
</p>

<p>
Stamford unlimbered his stiffened
legs and raised himself in the buggy to look out
over the valley of the H-Lazy Z.
</p>

<p>
"It's my place all right," he moaned.  "I
don't care what ranch it is.  I didn't think
Canada was so wide as that sixty miles of
prairie.  Sixty miles!  Humph!  I've a
complete set of disarticulated bones that's ready
to go into any witness box and swear it's at
least umpteen million miles, and then some."
</p>

<p>
The youthful driver grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'd get used to that.  I 'member
when <i>I</i> was raw&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, young man, for about eighteen
hours you've been rubbing my rawness into me.
Lord knows you didn't need to!  This rattly,
lumpy, jumpy bone-shaker you call a carriage
would make any body raw that's not made of
cast-iron.  How the dickens Cockney Aikens,
to say nothing of his wife and the ranch outfit,
can contemplate that sixty miles with sufficient
equanimity to stick the job is beyond my
limited experience."
</p>

<p>
"Golly, mister, Dakota Fraley&mdash;Two-Gun
Dakota&mdash;bosses the outfit.  He's fit for anything."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  Dakota seems to have a rep."
</p>

<p>
"Dakota Fraley," confided the driver, "is
a gunman, a dead shot with either hand.  He's
lightning on the draw and was never known to
miss his man.  He's the toughest of the tough,
a broncho-buster that takes all the prizes at
the contests&mdash;and they say he's got so many
men he lost track years ago.  But, say, he's
a dead-game sport.  Ju hear about the police-court
case&mdash;for shooting up the town that
time?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford knew every word of it, but the lad's
story was worth hearing, so he only looked
interested.
</p>

<p>
"He just ponied up seventy-five simoleons
without a wink.  I think old Jasper was hoping
he wouldn't have it, so he could send him
down for a couple of months.  Gee, I wouldn't
send Dakota Fraley down, not by a long
sight&mdash;least, not unless I was dying or something
and wouldn't be there when he got out.  I
wouldn't fool with Dakota Fraley, no sir-ee!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford heard it with fitting solemnity.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," he murmured, "that's how
the books put it.  I mustn't blame him."
</p>

<p>
"What d'you mean, mister?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, excuse me, lad.  Don't mind me when
I get wandering.  I'm often taken that way.
The doctor says I'm not really dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you go to wandering about <i>here</i> or
you'll get plumb lost."
</p>

<p>
Stamford cast a furtive eye back on the sixty
miles and shuddered.  Almost at daylight&mdash;and
that meant about two-thirty a.m.&mdash;they
had pulled out of Medicine Hat, for he
was determined to run no risk of a night in the
open.  One he had had already, and was
content.  That sixty miles of prairie hung
behind him like a pall, too oppressive to be
relieved by its varied monotony.  Here a line
of unaccountable sand-buttes, there a landscape
of rolling sweeps like the billows of a
petrified sea, and sometimes a stretch of dullness
that melted into the horizon uncountable miles
away; and over all but the sand-buttes dead
whispering grass, trembling in the blazing
winds of midsummer, and a lifelessness that
was uncanny.
</p>

<p>
His nerves were jangling still from the memory
of it and, delighted though he was at the end
of his journey, sundry and impressive qualms
that resembled fear made him question his
ability to cope with the problem he had set
himself.
</p>

<p>
He raised himself on his arms before the house
and tentatively extended one dead foot, drew
in his breath painfully, and held himself erect
by the buggy as both feet touched the ground.
</p>

<p>
"There are the stables, I guess," he pointed
out.  "I confess I don't know the proper
thing to do with you.  Will they feed you
there or here in the ranch-house?"
</p>

<p>
The driver gathered up the reins.
</p>

<p>
"They ain't going to have a chance to keep
me neither places.  I'm not taking chances
where Two-Gun Dakota is&mdash;me with no gun
or nothing.  These broncs are good for another
ten miles.  I got a friend over at the Double
Bar-O.  That's good enough for me."
</p>

<p>
He tumbled Stamford's suitcase out, chirruped
to the horses, and rattled away eastward
up the slope.
</p>

<p>
Stamford was suddenly oppressed with the
loneliness of things.  About the ranch-house
was not a sign of life, and the ranch buildings
two hundred yards away seemed to be equally
deserted.  He glanced hurriedly about and
launched himself on the noisy gravel walk to
the door.  He was thrilled with the vastness
of things, the tremendous silence, the frowning
cliffs across the river, the pettiness of mere man;
the gravel crunched pleasantly under him as
he walked.
</p>

<p>
Receiving no reply to his persistent knocking,
he lifted the latch.  The evidences of recent
life within pleased him mightily, especially the
signs of a woman's presence.  Mary Aikens'
darning lay on the table where she had dropped
it.  A pile of folded newspapers and magazines
covered the top of a smaller table against the
wall, almost crowding off a smoker's tray and
pipestand.  The pictures on the walls, the
shiny stove, the cushions piled with attractive
abandon on couch and chairs, and, above all,
a piano&mdash;Stamford felt his spirits rise.
</p>

<p>
Here were luxury and art as he had not
before seen them on the prairie.  Here was
more than temporary makeshift.  Here, he
read, was a woman determined to make life out
there, sixty miles from the nearest post office,
railway station, and store, independent of its
isolation and inconveniences.
</p>

<p>
He spied the open door to the kitchen and
passed through, gathering from the array of
tin boxes that his host and hostess were more
than temporarily absent.  It made him
uncomfortable.  His mind refused to grasp the full
significance of the situation in which he found
himself.
</p>

<p>
He was wondering vaguely what to do, when
the outer door burst violently open, and he
started like a thief caught in the act.  Dakota
Fraley was standing in the doorway, peering
about with an evil frown.  Through the kitchen
doorway he caught sight of Stamford and
strode quickly across the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
"What you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford's attempt at propitiation was a wan
smile; his heart was pattering uncomfortably.
</p>

<p>
"Just as you entered, Dakota, I was
wondering the same thing.  Mr. and Mrs. Aikens
are not at home, I take it."
</p>

<p>
"And won't be for a week, maybe," barked
Dakota, standing with legs wide, his thumbs
caught in his belt.
</p>

<p>
"I gathered that from the lay-out."
</p>

<p>
"Tell 'em you was coming?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I knew the rule of the prairie."
</p>

<p>
"What rule?"
</p>

<p>
"That a visitor is always welcome.  Have
they been pulling my leg in that, too?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota thought over that a moment.  His
dislike for the little editor since the shooting-up
scene, as well as for any visitor to the ranch,
inclined him to kick Stamford off the place.
But there was Cockney to reckon with.
</p>

<p>
"There's nobody here to welcome you&mdash;you
can see that," he grunted.
</p>

<p>
"I was noting it," said Stamford quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, you two-by-four, none o' your
insults.  This is a mighty big prairie to be
alone on of a night ten miles from the next
stopping place.  There's nicer things for a
tenderfoot, I warn you."
</p>

<p>
"But one of them isn't forcing myself on
your society, Dakota Fraley.  Yet, at the
moment you're my host by proxy; my lips
are sealed."
</p>

<p>
Dakota calmed.  He was uncertain of the
efficacy of anything but a gun in dealing with
insults, but to draw on such a little tenderfoot
was not to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
"Driver coming back?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"By the way he galloped away I came to the
conclusion he hoped never to have to," smiled
Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"We'll lend you a horse."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, but I can walk better without one."
</p>

<p>
"I see you walking ten miles at this hour o'
the night, I do?" jeered Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't think of taking you from your
own comfortable ranch for such a trifling spectacle.
I won't mind if you take it for granted....
But perhaps a horse would be company.
Lead me to it."
</p>

<p>
He pushed past Dakota and started toward
the ranch buildings, the foreman following,
obviously ill at ease.  As they neared the
cook-house door a sly smile crossed the latter's face.
Several cowboys came out.
</p>

<p>
"I've found it, boys!" yelled Dakota, with
a wide grin.  "The only and original
tenderfoot&mdash;guaranteed to eat peas with a fork,
crease his pants every month, say 'fudge'
when he means 'damn,' and take a saddle-horn
for the back of a rocking chair.  Only he
doesn't like us.  He's decided to move on.
We're bold bad men.  Alkali, trot out Joe-Joe."
</p>

<p>
Dakota's grin repeated itself in several faces.
Stamford, aware that silence was safest, said
nothing until Dakota was through.
</p>

<p>
"It's a shame to inflict myself to the extent
of a horse on your already overtaxed hospitality,"
he said.  "I promise to pay livery
rates."
</p>

<p>
"Best put it on yer will, ole hoss, an' right
now," drawled Bean Slade through the whiffs
of a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
Stamford looked up with a glint of understanding.
</p>

<p>
"My executors will naturally pay my debts
first&mdash;if my estate is equal to it."
</p>

<p>
"Yu seem to like Heaven best, kid," muttered
Bean.  "It's close up to here&mdash;the way yu're
going."
</p>

<p>
"One might be forgiven for preferring the
other place," replied Stamford.  "At least
there's only one devil there."
</p>

<p>
The cowboys grinned appreciatively.
</p>

<p>
"Best call it off, Dakota," suggested Bean.
</p>

<p>
Dakota frowned.
</p>

<p>
"If you geezers know of any quicker way of
getting off the H-Lazy Z than by Joe-Joe,
trot the idea out and let's look at it, and
precipitous-like."
</p>

<p>
Joe-Joe, a mule-faced, conscience-stricken
creature, with a scraggly tail that never stopped
flicking, came humbly up at the rear of Alkali,
bridle and saddle having been adjusted in the
stables to an accompaniment of clatter that
confirmed Stamford's suspicions.  Still he had
no thought of funking.  He reached out for
the rein.
</p>

<p>
His hand was pushed roughly aside, and
Bean Slade vaulted into the saddle, cigarette
between his lips.  With a touching appeal in
his wandering eyes Joe-Joe looked about on
the unsympathetic audience, then, with a jerk
that was startling even to see, he lowered his
head, arched his back, and leaped straight up
with stiffened legs, all part of one movement.
</p>

<p>
When he landed, every bone in Bean's lanky
body rattled; and before they had time to
rearrange themselves Joe-Joe was in the midst
of a new gyration that loosened Bean's sombrero
and cigarette.
</p>

<p>
The cowboys looked on, laughing, darting sly
glances at Stamford to see how he was taking
his escape.  Dakota was divided between anger
at Bean's interference, and satisfaction at the
trepidation on the little editor's face.  Joe-Joe
continued to leap and twist and kick, Bean
shouting encouragement and slapping the
steaming thigh behind him; but when the horse
straightened out for a run, his rider freed his
feet and slid over his rump.
</p>

<p>
"Our show outlaw," he explained to Stamford,
stooping to recover hat and cigarette.
"Yu can see why yu'd need to say yer say in
yer will."
</p>

<p>
Dakota accepted his defeat with a laugh.  He
had had his fun, and the sympathies of the outfit
were against him.
</p>

<p>
"Any other ladylike nags about the place
you'd like to break for us, my little man?" he
gibed, clapping Stamford on the back.  "The
H-Lazy Z's at your disposal."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Dakota, then I'll stay a while."
</p>

<p>
Bean Slade shoved out a long, limp hand.
</p>

<p>
"Bully fer you!  Yu've got the guts!"
</p>

<p>
"If you're going to kick about till the boss
comes back," said Dakota, "you'd better shake
hands with the bunch.  Give your hoof to
Alkali Sam.  Alkali wasn't christened that&mdash;if
he was ever christened at all.  Somebody
musta been reading a wild-West story and
thought Sam looked like the leading villain.
It's commonly hinted he christened himself.
He's a would-be devil, a gen-u-ine bad actor&mdash;in
his own mind.  Alkali'd rather be called
that than get his man on the draw.  It saves
a lot o' shooting&mdash;and it's less dangerous, a rep
like that.
</p>

<p>
"And this one&mdash;where's your flapper, Muck?&mdash;he's
Muck Norsley.  Nothing's too dirty
for muck&mdash;hence, Muck.
</p>

<p>
"The Dude there has been known to take a
bath, comb his hair with axle grease, and change
his shirt, all in the same year.  Dude, you ain't
doing us justice.  Your neckerchief&mdash;well, it's
a bit mussed, and a tailor might improve them
chaps.  Look nifty for the gent.
</p>

<p>
"General Jones derives his cognomen, so to
speak&mdash;not from the army, bless you, no, but
because he's generally drunk, generally loafing,
generally a cuss.  No one thinks his name's
Jones, least of all the Police.  And that's why
General's so popular.
</p>

<p>
"Bean Slade, here, forced his name on us.
He has to stand up seven times to make a
shadow.  When the wind's ripping things to
kingdom-come we send Bean out to do the
punching; he just turns sideways.  Truth is,
Bean's the lady-killer o' the bunch, that is, when
Dude's not in glamorous garb.  Oh, Bean's
the sly one.  There's only one lady in ten miles
here, and Bean's her lady's-maid.  Meaning
nothing vulgar," he added hastily at sight of
Bean's glowering brows.  "Even in town Bean
looks at every female as if she's val'able china
and li'ble to be broke."
</p>

<p>
Stamford, conscious of his incapacity to reply
in kind, solemnly shook the offered hands;
which tickled them.  The Dude first rubbed
his palm on the side of his chaps, General
Jones pumped his arm until his head shook,
and Muck Norsley murmured something he'd
heard somewhere about being glad to meet
him.  Bean Slade muttered a sheepish "Ta-ta!"
and preferred his package of cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
The frowsy-headed cook thrust his face
through the back doorway and announced that
"chuck" was on, and, in the fading light of
a late summer night&mdash;where the sun sinks about
ten o'clock in mid-summer&mdash;Stamford seated
himself before his first meal with a family of
cowboys, a bit uncertain of the good taste of
dining with an unwilling host, but determined
now to carry the adventure to the end.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the meal, which seemed to Stamford's
hungry but as yet fastidious taste to
consist largely of pork and beans, with a later
stratum of pie, there was a disposition among
the others to show off, developing quickly, as
Stamford's interest grew, to an effort at fun
at his expense&mdash;not meanly, but with a twisted
idea of sustaining their reputations before a
tenderfoot.  Stamford felt something of it but,
not knowing how to receive it, concentrated
on the meal.  In that he unconsciously did
well; so that when the pie was well washed
down with strong coffee he remained the
butt of their fun, but with less malice than
before.
</p>

<p>
Muck Norsley's appetite seemed insatiable.
When the others had drawn back and were
smoking the package of cigarettes that was a
special recognition of visitors, he continued to
munch at the last piece of pie&mdash;his fourth,
Stamford was certain&mdash;swallowing noisily
from his coffee cup, the spoon held in the
practised crook of his first finger.
</p>

<p>
"Muck always was delicate," said Dakota,
by way of apology.  "Don't you know, Muck
Norsley, that it ain't good manners to eat when
everyone's through?"
</p>

<p>
"Everyone ain't through," replied Muck.
"I ain't.  It mightn't be good manners, but
it's good pie.  Anyway, this is supper, not
sassiety.  If that isn't so, tell yer pal and
fellow-villain to take his feet outen my coffee."
</p>

<p>
Alkali pushed his feet further on the table,
brushing aside the dishes, and relit his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"You big lubber, you!" yelled Muck.
"Can't yer see this is comp'ny?  You know
yer dassent do it when we're alone, you&mdash;you
insult ter decency!"
</p>

<p>
"Muck," warned Alkali gravely, tossing the
match over his shoulder, "yo know how easy
I'm roused.  I've et bigger men'n yo fer
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"Alkali Sam," returned Muck, with equal
gravity, "I ast yer tuh remove them blots on
the innercent habits o' the H-Lazy Z seminary
fer perlite young ladies.  I don't often ask
twice."
</p>

<p>
Alkali ostentatiously loosened his Colt.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Dakota, take this toy while I'm
good-tempered.  We ain't got time fer no
funeral."
</p>

<p>
Stamford caught the wink that accompanied
Alkali's toss of the revolver before his face, but
it did not prepare him for the explosion that
filled the room the instant it touched Dakota's
hand.  The bullet whistled so close that he
ducked.
</p>

<p>
When he straightened, Dakota was looking
into the smoking muzzle of the Colt with an air
of intense surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Funny things, guns!" murmured the foreman.
</p>

<p>
"Darn funny!" growled Stamford, taking
fresh hold of himself.
</p>

<p>
The smile he saw flitting over the faces of
the cowboys had warned him that he was the
victim of a bit of gun-play dangerous in the
hands of less expert gunmen than Alkali and
Dakota.
</p>

<p>
Muck Norsley swept his hand over the table,
scooping up a sample of the flies that had all
through the meal been robbing Stamford of
some of his appetite, fished two from his coffee,
and carried them to the door, where he gravely
released them.
</p>

<p>
"I never did like the flavour of them flies,"
he muttered.  "Now over in Dakota they
come&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
During his absence at the door Alkali had
liberally replenished the supply of flies in his
cup, and Muck, noticing the disturbance in the
liquid as he was about to swallow it, promptly
despatched it into Alkali's face.
</p>

<p>
Before he could defend himself, Alkali was
on his shoulders, punching wildly.  Muck
heaved himself to his feet, caught Alkali about
the waist in a bearlike hug and, burying his
face in his tormentor's stomach, seemed to be
eating him alive.
</p>

<p>
Alkali beat himself free, howling all the time,
and rubbed his stomach as if in terrible pain.
</p>

<p>
"Gi' me the gun, Dakota, gi' me the gun!
Quick!  I'll fill the ring-boned, wind-galled,
spavined son-of-a-gun so full o' holes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Alkali always was fluent," applauded Dakota.
</p>

<p>
The two men were fighting round and round
the room, striking awkwardly, cursing, bunting
with their heads.  The others retreated to the
two doorways and the corners, making no
move to separate them.  Stamford circled the
table with bulging eyes; he had never seen
anything so furious and brutal before.
</p>

<p>
Alkali fell over a chair, and Muck, seizing
another, whirled it aloft.  But Alkali squirmed
beneath the table, grabbed Muck by the feet,
and brought him down with a crash.  Seated
astride him, he leaned over his victim, punching
with both fists.  Muck struggled vainly for a
moment, then seemed to give up in sheer
weariness.  Alkali gave a blood-curdling yell
and jabbed his fingers at the helpless man's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
In the dimming light Stamford seemed to see
the horrible gouging as in a dream.
</p>

<p>
"Stop him!  Stop him!" he screamed.
</p>

<p>
Alkali whooped his triumph and reached to
the table for a knife.  High above his victim
he drew it back, gloating over the blow that
would clench his victory.
</p>

<p>
"Not by a darn sight!" yelled Stamford,
hurdling a fallen chair and kicking with all his
might at the uplifted wrist.
</p>

<p>
Alkali uttered a howl of real pain and
clambered to his feet.  To Stamford's bewilderment
Muck followed him, grinning, but sidling
between the irate Alkali and his new foe.  The
injured man cursed volubly, holding his wrist
with the other hand, then he plunged toward
his gun, which lay on the table.  But Bean
Slade's long leg flashed out, and the gun rattled
away to a corner.
</p>

<p>
"Yu got what was comin' tuh yu, you goat.
Swallow yer medicine.  Thought yu was puttin'
it over on the li'l fellow, eh?  Looks 's if he's
got the last laugh."
</p>

<p>
"He's broke my wrist!" howled Alkali,
hopping about.
</p>

<p>
"Get out!" jeered Bean.  "Yer shure a
soft bad-man.  A li'l scrunt like him put yu
out o' business!  Haw!  Haw!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford was squirming beneath a burden
of chagrin at the revelation that all the time
they had been poking fun at the tenderfoot.
</p>

<p>
"Funny thing, feet!" he murmured,
contemplating his small shoes.
</p>

<p>
"Darn funny!" growled Dakota.
</p>

<p>
Stamford slept at the ranch-house and took
his meals in the cook-house.  It suited him
perfectly&mdash;in spite of flies and mosquitoes.
His search for health was accepted without
question among cowboys who imagined that
poor health was the curse of every tenderfoot,
the dose being multiplied in one of such limited
proportions.  General Jones expressed the
conviction that a month of roughing it would
make him so eager for "home and mother"
that bad health would look attractive by
comparison; and Bean slyly suggested that what
Stamford needed to buck him up was a few
more rough-and-tumbles like the lickin' he gave
Alkali.
</p>

<p>
Dakota looked into his guileless eyes and
ridiculed himself for having tried to get rid
of him.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning, before Stamford had
made up for the sleeplessness of the first part
of the night in a lone house on the prairie,
surrounded by a million shrieking coyotes, a
conference took place in the cook-house.  The
result of it was reported in part to him by the
information that he and Bean Slade and the
cook would have the ranch to themselves for
the next few days.  Stamford asked a few
questions, but his ignorance of ranching
deprived the replies of most of their significance.
For four days, therefore, he and Bean developed
the strange friendship that had commenced with
Dakota's personal attack in the shooting-up
of Medicine Hat, and had been strengthened by
the scenes of his first evening on the ranch.
</p>

<p>
At the end of that time Dakota returned with
three strange cowboys in the best of spirits.
The three strangers, Stamford learned, were
other members of the outfit whose work was
in more intimate touch with the herds.
</p>

<p>
"Ten bucks for you, Bean!" Dakota
announced jubilantly.
</p>

<p>
Stamford looked his enquiry.
</p>

<p>
"He's raisin' my wages fer lookin' after you,"
Bean explained; and everyone laughed.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
COCKNEY'S MYSTERIOUS RIDE
</h3>

<p>
Long after midnight of the short summer
night, Cockney Aikens and his wife
drove up to the Provincial Hotel, the
team in a lather but Pink Eye with lots of the
devil left.  Mary climbed down and pounded
up the night clerk, and Cockney, given the stable
key, took the team back himself.
</p>

<p>
As he emerged from the lane leading to the
stables, a Mounted Policeman, riding in late
from patrol, pulled up before him and stooped
to see his face.
</p>

<p>
"What's on at this hour, Cockney?"
</p>

<p>
The big rancher straightened furiously.
</p>

<p>
"Say!  Some day I want to get somewhere
where a bunch of interfering red-coats aren't
dogging my steps."
</p>

<p>
The Policeman laughed.  "I'm afraid you'll
have trouble doing that in this country."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll go back home, where a man's his
own boss."
</p>

<p>
"It didn't seem to suit you so well when you
were there."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  Cockney's tone
was almost a bellow.
</p>

<p>
"Sh-h!" soothed the Policeman.  "Everyone's
in bed but ourselves.  I suppose if you'd
liked England so well you'd have stayed
there.  No one in Canada sent for you, did
they?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney wheeled about and stalked up the
Provincial steps, the Policeman watching him
until the door closed behind him.
</p>

<p>
Cockney Aikens hated the Mounted Police.
In all his life nothing had so roused the depths
of hatred usually dormant in his big body.
If one came within sight he swore beneath his
breath&mdash;or aloud, according to the company.
He thought and spoke the worst of them, and
his unqualified dislike was unwilling to accord
them any credit, would grant no conceivable
purpose they fulfilled.  On the trail he passed
them without so much as nodding, and the very
few patrols that wandered at long intervals to
the vicinity of the H-Lazy Z avoided the
sullen hospitality of its owner.
</p>

<p>
The cause of this settled hatred was as simple
and unreasonable as that which lay at the root
of most of Cockney's emotions.
</p>

<p>
Early in his career in the Medicine Hat
district, when he was "going the pace" more
recklessly than since his marriage, one of his
uncontrolled orgies of drinking and gambling
had brought him hard against the red-coats,
and he had learned what a ruthless wall they
are for wrong-doers to butt against.
</p>

<p>
Medicine Hat was not a wild town, as cow-towns
go.  Drinking that threw a man on the
street in a condition dangerous to himself or
others was discouraged with a firm hand, but
gambling, so long as it kept under cover, was
winked at by the town policeman as the least
objectionable of the many vices common to a
section that lived largely on its nerve.
</p>

<p>
Whether there was more in it than that for
the policeman was open to question.  Poker,
and other card games of less skill and more
manipulation, were available to anyone who
knew the ropes.  A daring stranger to town
had reported to a local friend, who happened to
be an usher in the Methodist Church, that the
town policeman himself had directed him to a
game in progress&mdash;but this was challenged
when it came up before the town council.
One resort, the basement under a barber shop
on Toronto Street, was Cockney's favourite
den; and, with the gambling instincts of the
Englishman, and copious additions developed
within himself, his evenings in the fetid
atmosphere of smoke and whisky were times of
fever to more than himself.
</p>

<p>
One night, unlucky, urged to stake more than
he had ready money to meet, he emerged from
the den in a vile temper, convinced that the
cards had been stacked but unable to prove
it before a crowd of blood-suckers frankly
hostile to him.  At the moment the town
policeman happened to be on his rounds in
that quarter, and in sheer wantonness, Cockney
banged his helmet into the roadway; and when
the policeman seemed to show resentment, he
was tossed after his helmet.  But a Western
policeman, town or Mounted, faces such
contingencies with the donning of his uniform,
and Mason returned to the attack with drawn
baton.  Mason, baton and all, proved scarcely
exercise for big Cockney Aikens.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately two Mounted Policemen,
attracted by the crowd that had trickled up
from nowhere, arrived on the scene.
</p>

<p>
It was a brave struggle while it lasted, and
four bodies ached from it for several days, but
it ended with Cockney securely locked in the
cells.  <i>In the cells!</i>  The big fellow came to
himself and cried like a child.
</p>

<p>
But his shame was only commencing.  Next
morning the scene of his disgrace was transferred
to the police court, where Cockney, with
bowed head, scarcely heard the sentence of
fifty dollars or thirty days.  He realised it
when he discovered that his account at the
bank was drained to the last ten dollars to
pay the fine, owing to heavy recent drafts
thereon in settlement of his winter accounts
and the purchase of new stock for the ranch.
</p>

<p>
<i>And there remained unpaid his gambling
losses of the previous night.</i>
</p>

<p>
That was most terrible of all.  When that
afternoon he slunk from town with forty dollars
of gambling debts recognised only in IOU's,
his shame was complete.
</p>

<p>
In his mind the Mounted Police were entirely
to blame.  Before they interfered he was
having only an exhilarating frolic with Mason.
It was that strange hold of one of the red-coats&mdash;it
almost broke his neck, and twisted his
arm so that it still ached&mdash;that did the
thing.
</p>

<p>
And so, with the capacity for stubborn hatred
that required much rousing but defied
conciliation, he never forgave them.  They had
besmirched his honour&mdash;for four months he was
ashamed to show himself in the den under the
barber shop&mdash;and nothing could remove the
stain.  He would grind his teeth and swear
that if a Mounted Policeman were dying at his
feet for a glass of water he would not stoop to
give it to him.
</p>

<p>
When Cockney entered their bedroom in
the hotel he was too angry to speak.  Mary
was waiting for him, thoughtfully rocking in
an old rocker that was supposed to make cosy
a room that had outlasted its decorations and
furnishings years ago.  He glanced at her
swiftly, but whatever she had in mind, his sullen
mood seemed to alter it.
</p>

<p>
The clerk knocked and enquired if anything
was wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," cried Cockney, "a big whisky&mdash;straight."
</p>

<p>
His wife studied him anxiously as she went
about preparing to retire.  The hideous life
that would be hers for the next few days was
commencing earlier than usual.  Yet she was
thankful to be there to look after him.
</p>

<p>
Me seized the glass when it was handed
through the crack of the door, stared at it
a second, and placed it on the washstand
untouched.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be away for a few days," he told Mary
casually, as he washed.  "You'd better sleep
in; it's been a stiff day for you."
</p>

<p>
"You've had seventy miles of Pink Eye to
hold," she reminded him.  "You need the rest
more than I do."
</p>

<p>
He laughed bitterly.  "Rest?  There's no
rest for me now for&mdash;maybe for months.  I'll
be back about&mdash;about Saturday, I think."
</p>

<p>
She knew the folly of asking questions,
but she noticed that the whisky was not
touched.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to have been asleep only a few
minutes when she felt him lean over and gently
kiss her.  She did not open her eyes until he
was fully dressed in his ranch clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," he muttered, seeing she
was awake; and went out on tiptoe.  Though
it was broad daylight, no one was yet stirring
about the hotel.
</p>

<p>
When she awakened later and realised how
thoughtlessly in her weariness she had let him
go without trying to wring from him his
destination, she dressed hurriedly and went to
the stables.  Pink Eye was gone&mdash;Pink Eye, like
his master, untirable.  It made her thoughtful,
and with thought came a sigh that deepened
the lines about her eyes.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday he returned.  He rode quietly
into the stable yard, handed his horse to the
ostler, and sought his room.  He was clear-eyed,
but heavy with fatigue.  Without undressing
he dropped to the bed and was asleep
before Mary could draw the curtains.
</p>

<p>
Out in the stable Pink Eye was as weary as
his master.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens went into the streets, and in the
post office heard the latest gossip&mdash;a new case
of cattle-thieving off toward Irvine.  For hours
she walked up and down the streets with a
terrible ache at her heart.
</p>

<p>
That night her husband sent her to a show
in the "opera house," while he broke loose
up in the Toronto Street den and lined the
pockets of the usual sharpers on the look-out
for reckless fools.  Through a wretched
performance she sat without grasping even its
general idea, miserable, lonely, trembling with
indecision.  On her return to the hotel she
borrowed a railway time-table from the hotel
clerk and took it to her room.  For a long
time she sat rocking, staring into space, her face
pale, her little fists clenched in the fight she
was making, and at last carried the time-table
down unopened.
</p>

<p>
She hungered to get away from it all, to
sink her streaming eyes in a mother's lap, to
feel about her arms that sympathised without
questioning.  But her pride, and a curious
feeling about Jim, kept her to the duty she
had undertaken when she stood beside Jim
Aikens at the altar.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
STAMFORD'S SURPRISES COMMENCE
</h3>

<p>
Cockney and Mary Aikens returned
home to find Morton Stamford established
at the ranch.  He had enlisted
Bean Slade's special interest in an effort to
maintain himself in a saddle long enough to
sink asleep at night, sore but happy, with the
thrill of having ridden a horse.  For his use
Bean had selected a broncho burdened with
the name of Hobbles, "because she acts that
way," Bean explained.  Not a cowboy on the
ranch would bind himself to Hobbles' limited
capacities&mdash;more correctly, to Hobbles' mild
manner of getting about.  When Stamford
had learned that the horn was not a handle,
he discovered, as he thought, unsuspected
resources in Hobbles.  He confided it to Bean.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" replied the cowboy.  "Yu
can't tell me nothin' about Hobbles' speed.
She can cover the ground, but look at the
way she does it.  No self-respectin' cow-puncher
wants to get about in a rocking-chair&mdash;an'
that's about how much life <i>she</i> has."
</p>

<p>
So Stamford was content to reserve Hobbles'
unconventionalities for himself, convinced that
under his developing horsemanship Hobbles
and he might yet be able to face a ten-mile
ride without quailing.
</p>

<p>
His reception by his host and hostess was
bewildering in its fluctuations.  At first Mary
welcomed him with enthusiasm that was almost
pathetic.  Cockney closed his lips and went
about the chores in the house necessary after
a protracted absence.
</p>

<p>
"I guess the Provincial meals got too much
for me," Stamford explained.  "My doctor
prescribed rest, exercise, no worry.  It's the
cheapest treatment I ever took.  I remembered
your invitation, Mrs. Aikens."
</p>

<p>
Cockney examined his wife with raised brows.
</p>

<p>
"Or rather," Stamford hastened to correct,
"the invitation I twisted your words into that
day at Dunmore Junction.  Already I feel
rewarded, not only in a new vigour that has
made me almost reckless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let your recklessness run away with
you."  advised Cockney quietly, pausing in his
efforts to blow the kitchen fire into a flame.
</p>

<p>
"Already," continued Stamford, "I can
ride&mdash;<i>ride</i>.  At least, to-day I stuck to Hobbles
for ten minutes, and almost chose my spot
to fall on.  Only I didn't see the cactus.  If
you don't mind, I'll eat off the piano to-night."
</p>

<p>
"I can assure you, Mr. Stamford," said
Mrs. Aikens, "that the H-Lazy Z will be your
debtor as long as you can stay.  Jim will say
the same."
</p>

<p>
But Jim did not say the same&mdash;at least not
then.  Though Bean Slade and the cook had
arrived from the cook-house, Cockney bore
the brunt of the kitchen fire.  He remained
bent over it, blowing and watching, until the
flame burned bright.
</p>

<p>
"There isn't a ranch in the country closed
to strangers at any time," he said, slowly rising
from his knees and bending to brush them off.
</p>

<p>
A sensible embarrassment filled the room.
Stamford felt the chill of it, but the look he
surprised on Mary Aikens' face prompted him
to ignore it.
</p>

<p>
"Of course there's danger of a tenderfoot
out-Westing the West when he gets started,"
he said lightly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry," said Cockney, more genially.
"We'll hold you to the conventions."
</p>

<p>
Stamford was indignant inwardly.  Though
he had made himself Cockney's guest to prove
his faith in his host justified, he felt a twinge of
shame at accepting such lukewarm hospitality.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Mary, I thought I noticed a
difference in the last issue of the
<i>Journal</i>."  Cockney's spirits were unaccountably rising.
"It seemed newsier, better written."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," said Stamford, "like an old
employer of mine, you consider editors necessary
evils to justify the existence of the advertising
man.  Smith will get along all right with the
<i>Journal</i>.  I figured that an anæmic paper
for a few weeks is better than a dead editor
for a long time&mdash;at least from my point of
view.  In my efforts to uplift Western journalism
I seem to have pitted a puny constitution
against a vigorous tradition that all stomachs
look alike to the Provincial.  This little body
was beginning to buck."
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens had brought from town another
visitor, a small fox-terrier that Cockney had
picked up somewhere, he did not remember
where.  He only knew that when he woke one
morning he was forty-seven dollars out and a
fox-terrier in.  Mary was delighted.  It surprised
her that she had not thought of it before.
Cockney was less enthusiastic.  He was oppressed
with sundry misgivings of the manner in which
he had come by the dog, and out there on the
Red Deer was no place for a miserable little
creature no decent coyote would make two
bites of.
</p>

<p>
Imp had accepted the ranch from the moment
of his arrival as his own special possession,
and its occupants as created for his exclusive
amusement.  He was as keenly interested in
the rousing of the kitchen fire as was Cockney,
considered Bean Slade a rather boring plaything,
favoured Stamford with a tentative sniff, but
for his mistress had a deep though
undemonstrative affection.
</p>

<p>
Dakota Fraley lounged over from the bunk-house
and stood in the front doorway, tapping
on the frame to attract attention.
</p>

<p>
"Here's something you'll be interested in,
Dakota," called Mrs. Aikens.  "I managed to
get a couple of Montana papers for you.  Why,
look at Imp!"
</p>

<p>
Imp, christened more in hope than descriptively,
was crawling to Dakota's feet, head
outstretched, tail invisible.
</p>

<p>
Dakota smiled.  "They all do it.  Never
seen the dog yet didn't get on his belly to me.
Here!  Up you get!  Better go back to your
missus; she's jealous."
</p>

<p>
The dog raised himself obediently, but with
cringing body, and slunk back to Mrs. Aikens,
where he seated himself sideways in the shadow
of her skirts, watching Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"Just came to tell you, Mr. Aikens, that
I'd best get Pink Eye out of harness instanter
or he'll get himself out, and mess up the ranch
in doing it."
</p>

<p>
Stamford remembered then that, in the fever
of his new ranch life, he had forgotten to shave
that day.  He excused himself and retired to
his room, which adjoined the sitting-room on
the ground floor.  Cockney went with Dakota
to the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Dakota!" he was saying.  "Pink
Eye's going to make a driver all right.  I may
use him a lot.  He's got&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The rest of the sentence was drowned in
the closing of the door, but more of their
conversation came to Stamford through the
open window.
</p>

<p>
"Get those cattle, Dakota?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota shouted to Pink Eye before replying:
</p>

<p>
"Found a dozen or so."
</p>

<p>
"Far away?"
</p>

<p>
"Down toward the railway&mdash;east."
</p>

<p>
The cowboy busied himself pulling Pink
Eye to an even keel.
</p>

<p>
"Funny thing happened," he said.  "Spooky
rider got through the night-hawks the first
night and pretty near stampeded the bunch.
General got a shot at him&mdash;a big fellow, the
boys say, riding a devil of a broncho&mdash;but we
couldn't find any trace of him when it got
light....  We found some tracks though,"
he added slowly.
</p>

<p>
There was an appreciable period of silence
before Dakota went on: "I got my eye peeled
for him.  He'll be bucking better shooting
eyes than General's next time."
</p>

<p>
The whip cracked and the buggy rattled off
to the stables.  Stamford, peeping through
the window, his cheeks in a lather, saw Cockney
look after the retreating team a moment, then
strike away to the stables.
</p>

<p>
Shaved and freshly clad in a white tennis
shirt, Stamford emerged from his room and
found Mary Aikens superintending the
preparations for the night meal.  Bean Slade was
peeling potatoes, a big grin on his blushing
face, and a large blue apron before him that
Mary had insisted on tying under his chin.
The cook from the ranch cook-house was
mixing something on the table, while the
mistress was diving into cupboards and
shelves with the stores she had brought
from town.
</p>

<p>
She hastened to meet Stamford in the
sitting-room, a strange constraint in her manner.
While she nervously set about laying the table,
he occupied himself with Imp.  He wondered
what she had to say to him that required so
much courage.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll find time hang heavily
on your hands here."
</p>

<p>
She was leaning across to straighten a corner
of the tablecloth, and he could not see her
face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of that," he replied, giving
Imp a poke.
</p>

<p>
"We've&mdash;we've never had visitors before."  A
flush stole softly into her cheeks.  "You've
selected the last ranch to suit your purpose&mdash;though
it's healthy enough, I suppose.  The
Double Bar-O now&mdash;there are young people
there.  And the Circle-Arrow further east."
</p>

<p>
Apparently he was busy poking Imp's fat
sides, but beneath his brows he glanced at her
again and again as she spoke.  For some sudden
reason she did not wish him to stay.  That
suspicion determined his course.
</p>

<p>
"In five days," he declared, "there have
been no premonitory twinges of lonesomeness.
And if, with only three of us on the ranch for
three days&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Only three?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Bean Slade, cookie, and I&mdash;that was all."
</p>

<p>
"Weren't&mdash;&mdash;  Where were Dakota and the others?"
</p>

<p>
"Down south somewhere&mdash;Irvine way, I
think they said, in search of strays."
</p>

<p>
"O-oh!"
</p>

<p>
She stopped on her way to the kitchen and
turned into her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Stamford became suddenly aware of Bean
Slade's lanky, blue-aproned figure lolling in
the kitchen doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Yer shure lucky," said Bean, "gettin' the
missus to cook yer meals, 'stead o' cookie.
Mebbe we'll miss yu&mdash;fer the meals.  Not to
say cookie here ain't a real shuff when he
likes, but he don't like nowhar 'ceptin' here
at the ranch-house.  Look at that, now!"  He
turned to watch the cook relentlessly pursue
a stray fly that had managed to squirm through
the screen door at the back, where a great
number of its fellows, attracted by the odour
and heat, were jealously prying about for
entrance.  "One measly li'l insec' gi's him
the pip here; out at the cook-house he can
sarve flies twenty-seven different ways without
overlappin'.  But lookee here, Mr. Stamford"&mdash;he
leaned into the room and spoke
in a whisper&mdash;"don't yu go fer to tell all yu
heard us croakin' out there.  The boss mightn't
like it."
</p>

<p>
Stamford felt a glow of elation that Bean,
in his innocence, had furnished him with a clue,
but before he could follow it up, Mary Aikens
came thoughtfully back and went about her
work.  Bean slunk back into the kitchen and
nosed about for his own special fly.
</p>

<p>
Mary was in the act of reaching to a cupboard,
when her hand stopped and she turned
to the window.  An exciting sense of nervousness
and unrest about the ranch made Stamford's
heart leap.  He moved restlessly in his
chair.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!"
</p>

<p>
The dull thud of hoofs and the rattle of wheels
drew them both to the door.  A buckboard was
coming drunkenly down the eastern trail, its
horses, under the direction of an inexpert&mdash;or
drunken&mdash;driver, uncertain of what was expected
of them.  The smallest deviation from the
beaten track meant that one horse was mounting
the ridge and the other the prairie at the side,
the wheels following them in jerks from the
deep ruts in the black loam worn by the
unanimous track of every previous vehicle and
horse.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
THE FOSSIL-HUNTERS
</h3>

<p>
Stamford raised his eyes from the
wobbling wheels to the seat of the
buckboard.  Instantly he felt, rather than
saw, that it was the Professor and his sister.
Beside him Mary Aikens was puzzled, with a
nervous mingling of surprise and amusement.
With the instinct of her sex her hand went
to her dark hair, and a quick eye fell to the
spotless apron and moved on to her neatly
clad feet.
</p>

<p>
When the buckboard was near enough to
make out the Professor's extended hands on
the lines, his fierce concentration on the horses'
ears, his braced feet, and the threatening bounce
of his body as the wheel mounted the ridge,
the spectators in the ranch-house could not
control their laughter.  For the sake of
politeness Mary temporarily withdrew.
</p>

<p>
With several stentorian and anxious "whoas"
the buckboard came to a stop at the end of
the gravel walk, and Isabel Bulkeley, with a
sigh of relief, bounded out.
</p>

<p>
"Amos," she announced, "hereafter <i>I</i> drive."
</p>

<p>
The Professor, an amusing figure of mingled
satisfaction and relief, protested.
</p>

<p>
"Now <i>I</i> think I did that rather well.  Take
the exact end of the walk and the centre of the
buggy&mdash;I'm not more than a yard or two
out.  It's that left horse that dislikes me.  I
feel as if I must expend myself on that line&mdash;and
the other horse responds too.  When I get
time I'm going to invent a separate line for
each horse&mdash;if only for the use of amateurs.
As it is now, if one horse is of a contrary
disposition&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He had leaped over the wheel and was diving
a hand into a box in the back of the buckboard,
rummaging among bits of rock.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel!  Isabel Bulkeley!  Where's that
Allosaurus vertebra?  Oh&mdash;yes, here it is.
Goodness, how it frightened me!"  He raised
his head and beamed on them through his
large spectacles.  "Do you know, I don't
believe I've lost a thing&mdash;except confidence in
my driving."
</p>

<p>
An enormous handkerchief emerged from
his coat pocket and mopped his forehead.  The
hand that held the lines gripped them so firmly
that the horses were backing on him.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa!" he shouted, pulling harder.
"Mr.&mdash;Mr. Stamford, will you give to this equine
problem the touch I seem to lack?  If you
don't, I'm going to drop these flimsy bits of
leather and take the brutes in my arms.
</p>

<p>
"Some day," he went on, when Stamford
had taken the reins, "I hope posterity will
unearth the bones of that brute on the left&mdash;and
grind them to dust.  Yes, I do.  Sometimes
I can be really blood-thirsty.  But,"
he grinned, "I wouldn't be surprised if they
found mine at the same time, with Gee-Gee&mdash;what
funny names you give your horses!&mdash;with
Gee-Gee sitting on my chest enjoying his last
laugh."
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens, her eyes brimming with tears,
had rushed to meet Isabel with a hungry
welcome that was pathetic, seizing her hand in
both her own; and Isabel, after a moment
of surprise she could not conceal, flushed a
little and responded with moisture in her eyes.
But the few moments of the Professor's dilemmas
had served to conceal the little scene that
recorded more of the story of Mary Aikens'
lonely life than she would willingly have
exposed.
</p>

<p>
They were standing now, hand in hand,
laughing on the two men.  To Mary it was
enough that, for the first time, another woman
was to cross the threshold of the H-Lazy Z.
Isabel was still, Stamford thought, the fond
sister who took as much amusement as anyone
from her brother's artlessness.
</p>

<p>
She turned to her hostess.  "This is not
merely a flying visit, Mrs. Aikens.  Amos&mdash;my
brother&mdash;was dissatisfied with his searching
down the river.  We hoped you wouldn't mind
letting us camp on your ranch here while he
pokes about the banks."
</p>

<p>
Beside the buckboard Professor Bulkeley
was making the same request of Cockney, who
had come hurriedly up from the stables.
</p>

<p>
"The Double Bar-O&mdash;that is, I believe, the
technical name&mdash;seems to have been unpopular
among dying dinosaurs and their forbears.
Whether one should infer from that that they
avoided the locality as unhealthy, or found
it so healthy they couldn't die there, does
not appear in the evidence.  All I found there
we know as much about already as about last
year's weather or the origin of mumps.  The
further I prodded west, the more promising
the outlook.  This bit of bone, for instance,
is, I believe, of the Upper Jurassic period.
The Double Bar-O region is by comparison
disreputably modern&mdash;not earlier than the
Miocene.  This bone appears to be blood-cousin
to a megalosaurus we received once
from England.  It has all the&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite following you, Professor."  Cockney
was struggling to keep his face
straight.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, of course not.  I'm&mdash;I'm apt to
forget there are <i>people</i> live in the nineteenth
century.  I suppose they have their purpose
in the scheme of life&mdash;for our progeny of the
five-hundredth century to worry about, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
As he was speaking he was pulling from
the buckboard the canvas and poles of a
tent.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked Cockney, with a frown.
</p>

<p>
"Our tent.  If we could pitch it somewhere
along the bank of the river here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You can pitch it into the river&mdash;and that's
all."
</p>

<p>
"But we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Cockney kicked the canvas off the trail,
drew a cigarette and match from his pockets,
lit them in a leisurely way&mdash;and dropped both
into the canvas.  A second match he struck
and calmly held to a loose corner.  The cloth,
dry and brittle in Alberta air, smouldered a
moment, then burst into flame.
</p>

<p>
Stamford solemnly leaned over the blaze to
fan it with his hand.  Mary stood laughing.
Isabel was divided between alarm and wonder.
Only the Professor seemed undisturbed.  He
stood watching the growing blaze with interest.
</p>

<p>
"As a raw backwoodsman I would suggest
starting the blaze on the side toward the
wind."
</p>

<p>
Stamford followed the suggestion with
success.
</p>

<p>
A heavy smoke rose and swirled about them,
pungent and stifling.  The Professor whiffed
it once or twice and turned his back on it.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy, my dear, thinking of living in a tent
that smells like that.  I can't imagine any
other form of fumigation being sufficient."
</p>

<p>
"Now," ordered Cockney, "take your suitcases
into the house."
</p>

<p>
The Professor looked at him admiringly.
"I wish I could express myself like that.
Sometimes I find the language of the lecture-room
not exactly suited to buying oatmeal or
getting a tooth filled.  He means, Isabel, that we
must be his guests, in spite of ourselves.  On
him be the blame."
</p>

<p>
Cockney burst into a laugh that startled the
horses.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why you shouldn't find old
bones about here, Professor.  We seem to have
pretty nearly everything else anyone wants.
We've opened a sanitorium."  He nodded at
Stamford.  "Might as well add a seminary.
From to-day the H-Lazy Z ranks as a public
institution."
</p>

<p>
There was nothing offensive in the tone,
but about the laugh was a suggestion of recklessness.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," stammered the Professor, "I'd
be delighted if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"  He cleared his throat.
"General&mdash;I mean, Inspector Barker warned
me not to suggest it, but I feel I owe it to
myself and to the professional nature of my
visit to express the hope that&mdash;that if there's
any consideration&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you suggest such a thing again," interrupted
Cockney, angrily looking the Professor
up and down, "I'll carry you down and drop
you in the river."
</p>

<p>
The Professor, retreating before the blaze
of indignation, tripped over the board edging
of the gravel walk and fell.
</p>

<p>
"I meant no offence," he stammered, where
he lay.  "It's only my Eastern ignorance,
you know."
</p>

<p>
Cockney reached down and jerked him to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Gad!" he exclaimed.  "What a waste of
muscle!  You fellows with brains teeming with
junk scorn the good things the Almighty has
given you.  Here's Stamford dying to have
one little fibre of the sinew you ignore&mdash;and
you thinking only of a lot of old bones that
can't affect the price of cattle.  Well, heigh-ho!
Give me a month of you and I'll show you new
things in life to glow over.  You've the stature.
Maybe you'll learn out here to use it."
</p>

<p>
The Professor turned to bow over Mary
Aikens's hand, and she flushed with embarrassment
and pleasure at the courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"Your husband has offered to share with me
some of the fine things of life on the prairie,"
he said.  "It is a prophecy of the scope he
has, that I see before me the woman who shares
that life with him."
</p>

<p>
Stamford recalled with a malicious twinkle
a moment of intense chagrin in Inspector
Barker's office.
</p>

<p>
"How ingenuous!" he murmured sweetly.
"How simple and sweet and natural!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor's face went red.  Isabel's eyes
were dancing.
</p>

<p>
"I owe that to the Professor," Stamford
explained to Cockney and Mary.
</p>

<p>
"One of the things I don't share is my wife,"
Cockney observed abruptly, and drove away
with the buckboard.
</p>

<p>
Dinner&mdash;the night meal was dinner where
Cockney gave the orders&mdash;was such a time
of pleasant chatter and merry banter as the
H-Lazy Z had never dreamed of, though there
was a recurring element of constraint that
puzzled Stamford.  Cockney was a mass of
varying moods, now laughing uproariously,
now moody and watchful; and all the time
Mary Aikens was rent by the conflicting
emotions of delight, and of sensitiveness to
her husband's humours.  Afterwards Bean was
dismissed, and the two women undertook the
kitchen work.  Cockney and Stamford smoked,
the former the inevitable cigarette, the latter
his short curved pipe.  The Professor did not
smoke; he seemed to have missed most of the
habits of man.  While the two others talked in
the detached but perfectly satisfied periods of
smokers, he drifted to the piano and turned
over the music.
</p>

<p>
And presently, so softly and smoothly that
no one seemed to know when he commenced,
his fingers were moving over the keys to a
quiet refrain he had picked up from the pile
of music on the piano.  When Stamford looked
up, suddenly conscious of the melody of it,
it was not the Professor he saw, but Mary
Aikens standing in the doorway to the kitchen
with the dish-towel in her hand, tears in her
eyes.  So close to the surface had the unexpected
arrival of guests brought her emotions that she
did not know she was showing them.  Stamford
heard Cockney draw a sharp breath, and
the next instant his host stumbled up and
went into the bedroom, closing the door behind
him.
</p>

<p>
A gentle knock interrupted the Professor
before he noticed the consternation his wandering
fingers caused.  The latch lifted and Dakota
stepped inside, fumbling his hat, his hair oiled
flat from a centre parting, and a pair of fluffy
angora chaps held up by a belt several holes
tighter than was his wont.  He stood there,
embarrassed, looking from one to another.
</p>

<p>
When the music ceased Cockney came from
the bedroom.  He laughed noisily when he
saw Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, come in, Dakota.  This is civilisation
as the old H-Lazy Z never looked for it,
eh?  Guess you and I will have to take to
our glad clothes to keep in line."
</p>

<p>
There were no introductions&mdash;that would
have added to the embarrassment of the
uncomfortable cowboy.
</p>

<p>
"'Dakota!'" repeated the Professor
interrogatively.  "Does it so happen that you
come from my own country, the land of the
free, where floats&mdash;but, ahem! this is not
Decoration Day.  I can see from the light in
your eye that you understand.  May I have
the honour of shaking your hand?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota intruded no objections, though he
grinned foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"Your parents little thought," rambled on
the Professor, "that the name they gave you
in the cradle would be your password the world
over.  With no offence to my host and
hostess, and this eminently agreeable gentleman
on my left, I feel that I can take you to my
heart&mdash;or wherever people take their friends.
I must see more of you, my countryman."
</p>

<p>
Though the flamboyancy of it was flagrant,
and delivered with a twinkle, Dakota felt an
inclination to expectorate, but bethought
himself and coughed behind his hand.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Dakota, now that
I have you two residents together, I must
take advantage of it.  We have long known
that the banks of the Red Deer River are
replete with interest for the paleontologist.
The region around the Double Bar-O was
disappointing.  Perhaps your acquaintance with
the rocks about here will prepare me for what
I will find."
</p>

<p>
"Looking for old bones, Dakota," explained
Cockney, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
Dakota turned his eyes suspiciously from
one to the other several times.
</p>

<p>
"Seen a few bits o' stone that might 'a' been
bones once," he growled&mdash;"not such a lot o'
them."
</p>

<p>
"You no doubt are as familiar as anyone
with the banks hereabouts?" suggested the
Professor.
</p>

<p>
"I shore oughta be.  Seen every blessed
foot on both sides for a matter of fifty miles
or so a million times."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  And you've seen the fossils?  Where,
may I enquire?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota felt for a cigarette, found he had
neglected to put them in his new clothes, and
put a match between his lips instead.
</p>

<p>
"Seen a few to the east&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I've covered the ground myself rather
well in that direction.  It's the west I'm most
interested in.  It was several hundred miles
to the west, this side of the town of Red
Deer, where my hated rivals of the American
Museum of Natural History made their
discoveries&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not a da&mdash;I mean a durn thing to the west,
mister," Dakota broke in firmly.  "All I ever
seen in that direction was within three miles,
or at least four.  Lots o' them down here just
where the cliff starts, enough to keep you
going a dozen summers."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean you'd advise me not to go
further west?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd be wasting time, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Where are the fords&mdash;or the ferries&mdash;or
however one crosses the river?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota glanced furtively up into the
Professor's guileless face and looked across at
Cockney before replying.
</p>

<p>
"Course there ain't no ferries.  Never saw a
blessed bone on the other side anyway."
</p>

<p>
"The only ford about here," volunteered
Cockney, "is a mile or so to the east."
</p>

<p>
"West it's all canyon," added Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," asked Cockney, "do you
ride any better than you drive?"
</p>

<p>
Professor Bulkeley shrugged his great
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I regret to admit that it's not one of my
few accomplishments."
</p>

<p>
"Not ride?"  Dakota broke into a relieved
laugh.  "Then you don't need to worry about
anything further away than four miles&mdash;you'll
never get there.  You can't drive over these
prairies, you know.  They ain't as smooth
as they look.  Wait till you've tried it."
</p>

<p>
"I <i>have</i> tried it," groaned the Professor
feelingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dakota," said Isabel shyly, "<i>I</i> ride&mdash;only
a little, I suppose, compared with your
Western girls."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you did, miss," said Dakota gallantly.
"I could tell from the cut o' you.  But I
bet"&mdash;he looked the Professor up and down
with professional eye&mdash;"I bet I could have
him riding in a week&mdash;only I ain't got time,"
he added hastily.  "I know the shape when
I see it.  Now, the tenderfoot here"&mdash;Stamford
squirmed&mdash;"he'll never make a rider.
Ain't got the right-shaped legs, nor the
body-swing.  The minute I seed you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He became conscious of his unusual loquacity
and stopped.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll teach me Western ways of riding.
Dakota," smiled Isabel.
</p>

<p>
The cowboy grinned and rubbed his hand
across his lips in sheer delight.
</p>

<p>
"Shore, miss."  He looked up at the clock.
"Is it too late now?"
</p>

<p>
"They're going to be with us for months,
Dakota," laughed Mary Aikens.  "We mustn't
unfold all our pleasures the first day."
</p>

<p>
Dakota rose to go, started to stretch,
bethought himself, and addressed Cockney.
</p>

<p>
"About them staples, Mr. Aikens.  We can't
do much more to the new corrals till we have
'em."
</p>

<p>
"I forgot them in town, Dakota.  We'll
have to send one of the boys in for them."
</p>

<p>
When Dakota was gone Cockney addressed
the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't advise you to try to ford the
river in that buckboard."
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't advise me to try it without
the buckboard," laughed the Professor.  "A
bath-tub of water gives me a panic.  And I'd
never feel satisfied if I didn't cover all the
ground."
</p>

<p>
"If it wouldn't be too late then," said
Cockney, "I'd let you find out by trying.
It's safe enough if you know the trail,
and the river isn't high.  Better learn to
ride."
</p>

<p>
The Professor glanced guiltily at his sister.
</p>

<p>
"Amos," she reminded him sternly, "you
said you'd learn."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he replied, "I'm funking."
</p>

<p>
"Let me give you the recipe," said Stamford.
"You take Hobbles&mdash;it must be Hobbles;
she's used to it by now&mdash;you take Hobbles
to where the ground's soft.  You get one
able-bodied cowboy to hold her head and
another&mdash;<i>you</i> might need two&mdash;to lift you into the
saddle.  Close your eyes, breathe the quickest
prayer you know ... and brush the dead
grass off your clothes where you landed.  The
cowboys'll catch Hobbles.  One little secret I
haven't yet told anyone: sneak your feet
from the stirrups while you're praying.  It's
far easier to fall then."
</p>

<p>
But the Professor shook his head stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be fair to the Institute to risk
losing those old bones out there on the rocks
by risking these bones.  That, you see, is the
comparative values of the products of the
Mesozoic and the Quaternary periods.  It may
be a distortion, but it's my job."
</p>

<p>
"Then," declared Stamford firmly, "you're
not going to save your bones and risk your
sister, until we've tried the ford without her.
I'm going with you myself."
</p>

<p>
"How ingenuous!  How sim&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Stamford raised a warning finger.
</p>

<p>
"Not that, Professor, not that!  To date
we're even.  If you reopen the feud, I swear
I'll have the last word, if I have to leave it set
in type."
</p>

<p>
The Professor's eyes twinkled about the room.
</p>

<p>
"If my dead body is picked up among the
cliffs, here's the murderer.  I can't always
be sure of having Isabel along to protect
me."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid, Mr. Stamford," said Isabel,
"he's grown rather dependent on me."
</p>

<p>
"Then he can't learn independence earlier,"
persisted Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"And he's going to need it some day,"
laughed Cockney.  "There are other men, Miss
Bulkeley."
</p>

<p>
"The necessity for concentration in a task
like mine&mdash;&mdash;" began the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't excuse selfishness," Stamford filled
in.  "To-morrow I'll be your assistant.  We'll
risk our valueless lives together on that ford.
The little man has spoken."
</p>

<p>
"Such a quaintly practical way of expressing
his devotion to your sex, my dear!" said the
Professor to his sister.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
STAMFORD GOES FOSSIL-HUNTING
</h3>

<p>
They did not go fossil-hunting on the
morrow.  Instead, the Professor
preferred to spend much of the day with
his countrymen at the cook-house, while Isabel
hunted Dakota up and took her first lesson
in an art of which she had little to learn.
Stamford, feeling unaccountably out of things,
sulked under the pretext of reading.
</p>

<p>
He was oppressed with a sense of the futility
of his mission, where so many side-issues
were so much more vital than the purpose of
his visit.  Just what that purpose was he had
to revive by sundry uninteresting reminders.
Of mysteries about the H-Lazy Z there were
enough to encourage the hope that some day
the big thing he was searching for would stumble
into the light&mdash;and he must be there to see it.
Cockney's innocence was not so assertive now
as it once was; perhaps in his foolish idea
of proving the Police wrong he would only
convict himself.
</p>

<p>
The Professor was frankly extending his
information about ranch-life, and the humorous
twists to his queries and replies immediately
made him a favourite with the cowboys.  They
tried to express their approval by teaching
him to ride, hunting out Stamford at last to
put him through his paces as a sample of one
week's lessons.  The Professor shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"The difference between us is in the results
of failure.  A man of his size scarcely ruffles
the grass where he lights.  The seismometers
at my own Institute would record my unseating
as my only epitaph worthy of note."
</p>

<p>
Dakota and Isabel whirled down the slope,
Dakota liberally applying his whip without
gaining ground.  Right on top of the group
about Hobbles and Stamford they drew up,
so close that Hobbles herself reared a little.
Stamford promptly slid off on his back.
</p>

<p>
"Hobbles," he chided, "we were showing
off.  I'm disappointed....  I'm also surprised.
I'd clean forgotten a horse rears, though I've
seen it in pictures.  Dakota, should I wrap
myself round the pommel when she does
that?"
</p>

<p>
But Dakota was too busy with troubles of
his own.  When the two riders pulled up,
Isabel was off first.  With an angry flush she
snatched Dakota's quirt from his unresisting
hand.
</p>

<p>
"If you use your whip once more, Dakota,
I'll never ride with you again.  I don't want
to call you a brute, but I got quite as much
speed out of my horse without punishing him."
</p>

<p>
Dakota was staring down into her indignant
eyes, too surprised to speak.
</p>

<p>
Stamford cocked an eye at him.  "When
you hang and quarter him, Miss Bulkeley, I'd
like you to save those chaps.  I think they'd
become me."
</p>

<p>
Isabel's anger had already fled before Dakota's
helplessness.  She laughed apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Dakota.  I suppose I'm not
used to Western ways.  But I won't get used
to that."
</p>

<p>
Dakota took off his Stetson.  "Not used to
them!  By Samson, miss, there's nothing in
the West can beat you!  If you could come
along with us on the ranges we'd show you life.
We're going to be busy out there for the next
couple of months."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't I come?" asked Isabel innocently.
</p>

<p>
Dakota looked at the other cowboys, and
they all laughed, without explaining.
</p>

<p>
"Can I come along in my buckboard?"
queried the Professor.
</p>

<p>
Dakota elaborately explained the work of
the ranges&mdash;<i>too</i> elaborately, it seemed to
Stamford&mdash;and the Professor and his sister listened
with evident interest, the former asking foolish
and wise questions that brought equally varied
replies.
</p>

<p>
"I'm coming out here to the cook-house
often," gushed the Professor, as the call came to
lunch.
</p>

<p>
"Shore!" chorused a half-dozen voices.
</p>

<p>
"And bring your sister," said Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"We're your debtors for the summer," bowed
the Professor, backing away.
</p>

<p>
"I do love the native," he enthused to Stamford,
on the way to the ranch-house.
</p>

<p>
"The funny part of it is," laughed Stamford,
"that Dakota and the H-Lazy Z outfit are the
only cowboys about who <i>aren't</i> natives.  They're
your own countrymen."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stamford," chided Isabel, looking slyly
at her brother, "you have a drab soul.  Why
can't you let Amos enthuse?  It's what he
grows fat on."
</p>

<p>
"Is it a prescription you're giving me?"
asked Stamford.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, feeling a little foolish in
his new rôle of gallant&mdash;as the Professor called
it&mdash;Stamford stretched his five-feet-odd on the
seat of the buckboard beside the towering
six-feet-three of his tormentor.  Down the
river trail, and thence along the edge of the
rough beach rock below the corrals, the skeleton
buggy bounced eastward to the only ford west
of the Double Bar-O.  The one consolation
to the injured pride of the smaller man was
that his companion insisted on letting him
drive.  Stamford had always considered his
accomplishments with the reins as born of
necessity rather than of experience, but the
Professor frankly refused to expose himself to
his own driving.
</p>

<p>
"I'd even let Isabel do the driving," he
confided, "if it weren't that I'd rather die a
man's death than live a male baby with a
female chaperon."
</p>

<p>
The ford was used only at long intervals
as access to pastures across the river.  It was
plain enough at its southern entrance to the
river flood, but to those who did not know it
the course thereafter was a matter of conjecture.
Stamford drove into the water with more
trepidation than he allowed himself to show,
anxiously searching the torrent ahead.
Mid-stream the water bubbled through the slats
of the buckboard, and the team, terrified by
the prospect, pulled up.  Stamford urged them
on, but Gee-Gee leaped against his mate, forcing
him into deep water.  The buckboard would
have overturned were it not built for almost
any situation into which a horse might force
it.  Stamford stood up to get a shorter hold
of the lines, but the Professor swept him back
to the seat with one strong arm and took
control.  Immediately the team seemed to find
bottom and courage together.
</p>

<p>
As they climbed the gently sloping grade
on the north side, the Professor lifted his hands
and stared at the reins.
</p>

<p>
"Goodness!  How did I get them?  Did
you&mdash;did you give them to me?  I hope I
didn't use force.  Honest, Mr. Stamford, I
never did such a thing in my life before.  Was I
very frightened?  Don't tell the women, please.
I'm horribly and disgustingly proud."  He
squared his shoulders.  "Say! with practice
I believe I could get on to the hang of the thing.
Let's get the practice right now when my
spirits are high.  We'll do that crossing again.
It looks shallower up this way."
</p>

<p>
Before Stamford could voice his protest
the team was around and re-entering the water.
With much waving of arms and shouting they
completed the double passage of the river in
safety by a better route.
</p>

<p>
"There!"  The Professor handed the reins
back and mopped his forehead with the big
handkerchief.  "I'm more puffed up than when
they Ph.D.'ed me.  Will you be good enough
to steer for that bulge in the cliff?  I like the
looks of the flexure there."
</p>

<p>
All day Stamford yawned and slept and tried
to read, and opened his eyes to the blazing sky
and heated rocks.  The Professor, his round
spectacles pressed close to the ground, poked
off among the rocks.  At lunch-time he reported
his delight at the prospects and could scarcely
stop to eat, though he managed his share easily
enough when he started.  In the evening they
drove back over the ford, Stamford hot and
irritated, the Professor gushing with anticipation.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he said, "I wonder <i>more</i>
neurasthenics don't give this climate a chance
at them."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!  You don't think I'm a
neurasthenic?"
</p>

<p>
"No offence, I hope.  I knew you were here
for your health, and I couldn't see&mdash;&mdash;  You'll
forgive me, my dear fellow, but I've dabbled
a little in medicine too."
</p>

<p>
Stamford had not prepared for enquiry into
his symptoms.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just generally run down&mdash;overworked,
I suppose, trying to stiffen the legs of a dying
newspaper."
</p>

<p>
"You were lucky to have such old friends
as the Aikens to see you through."
</p>

<p>
"But they're <i>not</i> old friends&mdash;very new, in
fact.  I happened to meet Mrs. Aikens one day
at a railway station; she invited me out."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mr. Stamford!  Those railway
stations!"  The Professor's big finger was
wagging in his face.  "Must I remind you that
Mrs. Aikens is married?  Oh, you bachelors!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford jumped.  "Great Scott, man!
What in thunder has that to do with it?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor coughed apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"I thought&mdash;well, anyone can see that Mr. Aikens
is none too&mdash;too eager, shall we say,
for visitors.  I'm sure it can't be for fear of
his wife.  She seems much more&mdash;more thoughtful
of him than he of her&mdash;if one may be permitted
to discuss his host and hostess.  I'm
sure I'd rather pay&mdash;or live in a tent, and be
independent.  Dakota, too&mdash;though he's a
countryman of mine, doesn't seem overjoyed
at our presence.  May I ask if you received
the same impression?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford chuckled.  "<i>You</i> were lucky.  I
had to face Dakota alone.  I'm sure my hair
went a shade lighter from the first impressions
<i>I</i> received."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;I thought so."
</p>

<p>
The big fellow settled back in deep thought.
Stamford tried to reassure him.
</p>

<p>
"There's no need to mind Dakota.  He's
only a third partner and doesn't really count
when it comes to a show-down."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm vastly interested in Dakota,"
murmured the Professor.  "He seems to have
something on his mind&mdash;some worry."
</p>

<p>
"They <i>all</i> do," Stamford blurted out.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford glanced from the corner of his eye
at the Professor.  He wanted to confide in
someone.  Dare he tell his suspicions to the
simple friend beside him, who seemed to be
stumbling on things.  He decided against it;
it would be no relief to himself and only add
to the Professor's worry.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
THE CONSPIRACY
</h3>

<p>
After dinner the Professor announced
his intention of strolling across to his
friends at the cook-house, but learned
from Cockney that only Bean Slade was about
the place, the rest having gone out on the
ranges for a few days.  Bean was finishing
some needed repairs about the ranch buildings,
and was going to town in a couple of days for
the staples.
</p>

<p>
"Dakota has made a place for your team
in the stables," Cockney said casually.  "He's
afraid to let strange horses loose in the corrals
at night: they might hurt themselves."
</p>

<p>
"That's thoughtful of Dakota," replied the
Professor.  "I don't know what Inspector
Barker would say&mdash;he lent them to me, you
know, as the safest in Medicine Hat&mdash;because
it must be stifling some nights in the stables.
If I relieved Dakota of all personal responsibility
I suppose he'd let them run loose in the corrals?
Gee-Gee seems to have a temperament that
requires airing."
</p>

<p>
"The stables are not stifling," said Cockney
shortly.  "Besides, Dakota looks after that
part of the ranch; I don't interfere."
</p>

<p>
Stamford took it outside and thought it
over.
</p>

<p>
"I'd almost forgotten my daily ride," he said,
entering the sitting-room a few minutes later.
"I have a premonition that should Hobbles
lose track of me for a day she'll forget my
weaknesses.  Will you come and see I get
fair-play, Miss Bulkeley?"
</p>

<p>
"Hobbles is in the stable, too," said Cockney,
"also Miss Bulkeley's horse.  The key's hanging
inside my bedroom door.  Help yourself."
</p>

<p>
Bean Slade suggested that he, as teacher,
accompany the two, but Stamford waved him
away with mock rudeness.
</p>

<p>
"You make me blush, Bean.  I'm taking
Miss Bulkeley for an evening ride&mdash;showing her
the sights.  One of them may be when Hobbles
decides to trot, but I must chance that.  I
usually last only three trots.  Hobbles has the
habit now of stopping at the third to let me
remount."
</p>

<p>
He bumped away, the perfect seat of his
companion giving his inexperience the laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how you do it, Miss Bulkeley,
but if I could ride like that I'd be a Mounted
Policeman&mdash;if they'd take me in.  Too bad
to waste it in Washington.  If everyone in
your city rides like you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk about civilisation, Mr. Stamford,"
she rebuked.  "It sounds so funny out here."
</p>

<p>
"Can I really be funny so easily?  Speaking
about civilisation, did you ever see anything
to beat this locking up of our horses?  What's
Dakota afraid of anyway?  I'm a funny critter,
Miss Bulkeley.  I never had an ambition to
ride Hobbles out of hours before.  Now I'm
wild to tear about this lonesome prairie at the
most unconventional hours.  If you'll turn
your back you won't be accessory to a crime.
I'd ride away and turn my back to you, only
Hobbles wouldn't leave your horse now, and
I couldn't make her.  I'm making a drawing
of this stable key.  Yours not to reason why."
</p>

<p>
He turned himself from her as much as he
could and outlined the key in his notebook.
</p>

<p>
"I was watching the sunset all the time,"
she told him when he had finished, "and
wondering."
</p>

<p>
"Don't wonder," he warned, with a sigh.
"I've started to, and I'm getting more tangled
every day.  Life was never like this before."
</p>

<p>
That night he made arrangements with Bean
to go to town with him two days later, and
retired to bed with a virtuous satisfaction at
having beaten his favourite enemy, though
when he thought of Cockney he had twinges
of conscience.
</p>

<p>
The second day of fossil-hunting with the
Professor was even less interesting and more
wearying than the first.  There was a limit
to the hours Stamford could sleep, and the
scorching heat among the rocks made eyes and
face sting.  After lunch he ended an
uncomfortable hour of dozing by hunting up the
Professor.
</p>

<p>
He found him curled in the shadow of a rock,
sound asleep, hammer and chisel by his side.
Stamford struck the rock a ringing blow with
the hammer.  With a bound the Professor
was on his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you, Stamford!  This heat&mdash;I guess
I must have succumbed to it&mdash;that and the
drone of the mosquitoes.  Did you ever feel
such a blistering heat, or see such armies of
mosquitoes?  I believe they've been here all
these years probing into these old bones under
the impression that they're succulent.  They've
discovered their mistake since I came," he
added ruefully.  "Six weeks ago one must
have had to hack a way through them in this
Edmonton formation.  In one short week I've
learned that the guiding star to some
antediluvian monster is the modern mosquito."
</p>

<p>
He seized his tools and began to hack a
crevice.
</p>

<p>
"There's a rib here, a big fellow.  I'm having
a great time tickling it&mdash;but the big brute
never quivers a hair&mdash;if he ever had any.  Down
there is a tooth.  Would you mind taking a
look and reporting on the quality of dentistry
prevailing in B.C. a million?"  He sat back
on his heels.  "I envy the advantages of those
to whom my bones will be fossils.  Present
palæontological graveyards have not to date
yielded up a single gold filling.  If you wouldn't
mind chalking off any outlines of bones on
that patch of rock down there, you could feel
that your day was not wasted."
</p>

<p>
Stamford yawned, made a few desultory
marks, and sat down.  The Professor continued
his hacking without bothering him further.
</p>

<p>
That night there was music at the H-Lazy
Z; the banks of the Red Deer canyon echoed
for the first time to sounds prophetic of the day
when ranches will give place to farms, farms
to towns.  Professor Bulkeley played, until he
felt every eye fixed breathlessly on him; then
he rose in confusion and insisted on Mary
Aikens taking his place.  To her accompaniment
a chorus formed, but in a few minutes
it had dwindled to a duet.  Stamford and
Isabel withdrew to a corner.  Cockney sat
smoking in gloomy silence.  Even the yelping
coyotes out on the prairie ceased their shuddering
clamour to listen&mdash;a space of silence Imp
did his resentful best to fill.
</p>

<p>
Stamford, seated by the screen in his room
before climbing between the sheets, heard
the voices of brother and sister over his head.
After a minute he started to a guilty consciousness
that he was straining to hear what
they said.  Noisily he jerked the window
down.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that he had just dropped
to sleep when Bean hammered at the screen
to waken him for the trip to town.
</p>

<p>
On the long drive Stamford found the cowboy
little more inclined to talk than was the
youthful driver who had brought him out.  It was
a keen disappointment to the self-appointed
detective, for he had counted on Bean's
affection for him providing the clues that were
evading him.  The lanky cowboy was willing
enough to talk on subjects of no possible interest
to Stamford, but of the ranch he had nothing
to say.
</p>

<p>
However, when, the second day afterwards,
he and Bean floated on the ferry across the
South Saskatchewan and climbed the cut bank
toward the northern trail, Stamford felt that
his trip was not wasted.  For one thing he
carried in his pocket a duplicate of the stable
key.  Also he had had a short conversation
with Inspector Barker that clung to the fringes
of his consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"For an invalid, Stamford," mocked the
Inspector, "you strike me as no friend of the
undertaker's.  If I didn't know your holiday
was a real loss in dollars and cents, I'd say
it was undiluted laziness.  I can't imagine
anyone, after three months in this
dollar-chasing country, sacrificing cash for chronic
fatigue.  Or is the fair Isabel there?"
</p>

<p>
"How did you know?" asked Stamford
amiably.
</p>

<p>
"That's the little birdie that tells secrets
to us married men.  If she hadn't come to
the mountain, then the mountain&mdash;&mdash;  How's
the Professor getting along with his new friends,
the Red Deer dinosaurs?  What's more to
the point, by the way, have you come across
a pair of big dogs that don't seem at home?"
</p>

<p>
"There's Imp," suggested Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"Who's Imp?"
</p>

<p>
"Imp is several degrees short of big&mdash;though
he certainly doesn't seem at home&mdash;unless
Dakota's about.  Legally he belongs to
Mrs. Aikens.  As a matter of fact Dakota has him
eating out of his hand.  The little chap attached
himself to our rowdy friend at first glance.
Love at first sight.  Took to him like a mouse
to cheese."
</p>

<p>
The Inspector was more than amused.  He
asked so many questions that Stamford realised
how easy it was to make the little terrier
entertaining.  Some of the brightest things he
determined to repeat to Isabel Bulkeley.
</p>

<p>
On the return Bean was more talkative,
without saying anything of value for Stamford's
purposes.
</p>

<p>
As they rolled, in the late afternoon, over
the gently waving prairie toward the Red
Deer, Stamford's weary eyes caught a movement
on the top of a rise to the west.  It came
once, and went, furtively, Stamford was
convinced.  Without seeming to watch he kept
his eyes fixed on the ridge, and after a few
minutes was rewarded by the tip of a Stetson,
as if someone were lying down, peering over
at them.  Bean was sleepily flicking the broncos.
</p>

<p>
When two more Stetsons appeared beside
the first, he made his mind up.  Calling Bean's
wandering senses back to earth, he waved his
arms.  Instantly the Stetsons disappeared.  A
moment later Dakota loped over the ridge and
down the slope.  He drew up several yards
away and beckoned Bean to him.  From the
furtive glances in his direction Stamford knew
he was the subject of their early conversation,
Dakota questioning, Bean explaining.  Then
they turned their backs on him.  The owners
of the other Stetsons did not show themselves.
</p>

<p>
As Bean clambered back over the wheel
Dakota shouted a last word:
</p>

<p>
"Get cookie to hustle a snack for you.  But
hurry.  We'll wait.  You can do it in a couple
of hours."
</p>

<p>
Bean flicked the whip and they started for
home on the canter.
</p>

<p>
"They aren't giving you much rest,"
sympathised Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"Naw," replied Bean shortly.
</p>

<p>
"The work about a ranch is certainly a
surprise to me.  What does Dakota want you
for?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a hell of a life!" grumbled Bean.
Thereafter he kept his lips closed.
</p>

<p>
An hour later Stamford was eating in the
ranch-house, trying to answer with intelligent
flippancy the questions poured at him.  The
promise of the stable key burning a hole in
his pocket was filling his mind.  To outwit
Dakota was his sole ambition at the moment.
If he could get Hobbles from the locked
stables&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Pleading fatigue, he retired early.  For some
time he heard the conversation in the sitting-room,
subdued for his sake, and then the stair
door closed behind the Bulkeleys.  The sudden
Western night had fallen.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
RIDERS OF THE NIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Stamford, softly lifting the screen from
his window, with the thrills of a
conspirator, climbed through and looked
about.  Once before he had stood in the midst
of the darkened prairie, with no thought then
than that he was temporarily but not
dangerously lost.  What lay before him now he
thought he had seen under every aspect from
his bedroom window.  But there was a
difference&mdash;a very disturbing difference.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the eeriest part of the vast prairies
he was stepping into an eery and illegitimate
adventure.  Deliberately he was involving
himself in a situation that could bring no
satisfaction but that of counter-plotting, and, were
he discovered, would expose him to even worse
suspicion than he deserved.  Most of the
exhilaration fled with the touch of the cold
night air on his face; the rest of it went before
the vividness of his imagination.  He marvelled
that a mere key should have uplifted him so
much, that a prospective ride at such an hour
should have gratified one to whom riding was
at best nothing more than an unpleasant
education.
</p>

<p>
Had his knees not trembled he would probably
have climbed back through the window with
a grin of shame at his foolhardiness, but with
terror tingling his scalp&mdash;&mdash;  He closed his
teeth and struck out stubbornly round the
corner of the house, avoiding the noisy gravel
walk.  Up the slope diagonally he crept, pointing
above the stables.  A sense of the necessity
of concealment, and a dim thought of future
needs, impressed him so strongly that he
scouted about for a long time back and forth
in search of the deepest of the scarcely visible
rolls he knew to mark the prairie everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Dropping down the slope then from above
the stables, he applied the key to the padlock.
His heart was beating fast, his fingers trembling.
The night was crammed with terrors, and
anxiety about the fit of the key made him
wonder what kink in his brain clothed an
adventure like this in attraction.
</p>

<p>
The key fitted.  He realised then that there
was no honourable escape but to go on.  Fate
was a funny thing.  He looked back once
toward his window in the ranch-house, took
a long breath, and stepped into the utter blackness
of the stable.  The horses sniffed, and for
a moment he tried to convince himself that
he had accomplished all he wished.
</p>

<p>
He knew Hobbles' stall, and, speaking gently,
advanced in the darkness.  By the light of a
sulphur match which he struck under the cover
of his coat he found saddle and bridle and
clumsily fastened them in place.  Once off the
wooden floors, the horse's feet met only hard,
soundless clay, and when he emerged into the
night, leading Hobbles, he was satisfied that
he could not have wakened the cookie, who
alone, he thought, remained in the ranch
buildings.  Pushing back the loop of the padlock
without locking it, he led off to the south-east,
avoiding bunk-house and ranch-house.
</p>

<p>
In the saddle he was more satisfied.  No
longer was he alarmed, but the exhilaration of
exercising a new art alone in the night
determined him on one burst of speed.  Stopping
suddenly at the end of a few hundred yards,
he turned his ear back with tingling veins.
Back there somewhere in the darkness he
imagined the beat of a horse's hoofs&mdash;and then
sudden silence.  Twice more he repeated it
with the same result.
</p>

<p>
Convinced now that he was really frightened
into foolish fancies, he rode on.
</p>

<p>
Out before him a strange lightness in the
sky attracted his attention.  Five minutes
later he could see dimly the lines of dead grass
on the crest of a ridge.  Riding slowly up a
slope, he looked over.
</p>

<p>
Four hundred yards away, in a deep coulee,
a fire was burning.  The bottom in which it was
kindled was carefully chosen for concealment,
and Stamford thrilled with excitement.  Between
him and the flames a bunch of cattle was kept
in hand by a temporary corral, two silhouetted
cowboys seated on the top rail.  About the
fire more cowboys were struggling with a steer
that lay on its side, and the smell of burning
hair carried to Stamford's nose the work of
the branding irons.
</p>

<p>
He wondered what mystic night rites he was
invading.
</p>

<p>
Seeking a nearer approach than was possible
from that direction, he rode back down the
slope and skirted about to the opposite side.
That side, the south, suited him better, too,
for the reason that, if he were detected, he
would not seem to have come from the ranch.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Hobbles with dropped rein in another
coulee, he climbed to the ridge.  There he
could see everything.  Though he knew next
to nothing of branding, and nothing whatever
of its dishonest forms, the hour of the deed,
the silence of the operations, and the choice
of location, convinced him that it was intended
only for the eyes of those immediately concerned.
</p>

<p>
He had just settled down to watch the thing
through, when from only a few yards away rose
the startling howl of a coyote.  The sound
galvanised more startling life into the group of
cowboys.  Those at the fire dropped their
branding irons and rushed for their horses,
and the two at the corrals were in their saddles
as the howl ceased.
</p>

<p>
Stamford tumbled down the slope and raced
for Hobbles.  As he clambered into the saddle
he realised with a gasp how hopeless flight was.
Even with such a short start he had confidence
that Hobbles could hold her own in the
dark&mdash;but <i>he</i> couldn't at such a speed.  Fifty
yards convinced him of it&mdash;fifty yards of giving
Hobbles her head and concentrating on the
horn in front.
</p>

<p>
He was considering what would happen
when they caught him, when a horse raced
out of the darkness behind him and shot past&mdash;so
close that a skirt blew against his legs
and he could hear a woman's voice whispering
to her mount.
</p>

<p>
So Mary Aikens, too, was out that night!
He forgot his fears and raced on.
</p>

<p>
But escape was hopeless.  From the ridge
came the thunder of the pursuing cowboys&mdash;and
then, close behind him, another horse.
It was gaining rapidly, the quirt lashing again
and again&mdash;Stamford could hear its gushing
breath at his hip....  And then he felt
himself pushed from the saddle with a force
that threw him clear of Hobbles' flying heels.
Over and over on the soft earth he rolled,
uninjured but too mystified and angry to
appreciate it.  He was rising to his feet to
face his captor, when he realised that the rider
who had unhorsed him had not even paused
in his pace.  Twice he heard the quirt fall, and
he remembered that as he left the saddle that
quirt had lashed over Hobbles' flank.  Without
a rider Hobbles would make the ranch.
</p>

<p>
A short hundred yards back pounded the
feet of the pursuing horses.  Stamford crept
swiftly out of their path and lay still.
</p>

<p>
When they were past he rose and started on
the run for the ranch.  Vaguely he felt that
in the speed of his return lay safety.  Reaching
the trail, he ran until his heart threatened to
collapse; but he would not stop to rest.
</p>

<p>
It was still dark when he topped the rise
overlooking the ranch buildings and crept
carefully down toward the house.  Though
there seemed little danger of discovery, he
kept to the depressions, zig-zagging downward.
He was thankful to his instinct for concealment
when he suddenly became aware of someone
standing before the ranch-house looking up
the trail&mdash;a woman.  He could make out no
more than the outline, but it must, of course,
be Mary Aikens.  He knew that she could have
no desire to be discovered by him, and he moved
more slowly, waiting for her to go.
</p>

<p>
His foot struck an unexpected mound and
landed him on his face.  As he lay in the grass
he saw her move swiftly away round the corner
of the house.  Both the front door and the
window of the Aikens' bedroom were in plain
sight, but she did not enter either.  He ran
on openly then.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the house no one was in
sight.  He hastened to the back, but the peg
left by the cookie on the outside of the screen
door when he departed after his evening's
work proved that no one had entered there
since.
</p>

<p>
Stamford leaned against the wall, completely
mystified.  He looked around, poking in the
grass, yet without hope.  The woman had
vanished.
</p>

<p>
He remembered Hobbles and, gulping down
a desire to cuddle into the bedclothes, hurried
to the stable.  The mysteries increased&mdash;<i>the
stable was locked</i>.  From the bunk-house came
the noisy snoring of the cookie.  With his
duplicate key he let himself into the stable and
found Hobbles&mdash;<i>unsaddled</i>&mdash;as if she had never
been out, though her sides were still slightly
warm.
</p>

<p>
Stamford crept out.  It was uncanny.
</p>

<p>
The soft padding of a horse down the slope
to the east, far from the trail, brought him to
a sense of his exposure.  Diving between two
buildings, he waited.  The rider turned off
toward the corrals, evidently moving with
caution, and a few minutes later Cockney
Aikens came round the corner of one of the
buildings that concealed Stamford, stopped a
moment to listen to the snoring of the cook,
and passed on to the house.
</p>

<p>
His steps were still audible when another
horse came along the same course, but it did
not turn off to the corrals.  Stamford slunk
further into his hiding-place as Dakota Fraley
rode past and drew up before the bunk-house.
</p>

<p>
To Stamford's amazement Bean Slade came
out.
</p>

<p>
"Who in h&mdash;l's been riding about here
to-night?" Dakota demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody&mdash;not that I've heard," returned
Bean in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"You been sleeping so tight, I guess, it ud
take a kick on the ear to wake you."
</p>

<p>
"I heard <i>you</i> far enough," returned Bean
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Bring the lantern."
</p>

<p>
Dakota dismounted.  Bean was a long time
with the lantern, striking several matches in
vain.
</p>

<p>
"No ile," he growled, with a curse.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  I have matches."
</p>

<p>
Dakota tried the padlock, unlocked it, and
entered the stable.  Stamford heard a match
scratch and saw a momentary flare through
the cracks where the mud had dropped out.
</p>

<p>
"That shore beats me," muttered Dakota,
as they came out.  "They're all there.  Let's
take a look at the corrals."
</p>

<p>
They went off around the stable, and Stamford,
creeping out, slunk up to the depressions
in the slope that had become in one night such
good friends to him, and returned to the house.
He discovered that he had left his screen out,
and a few hardy mosquitoes that defied the
chilly night were buzzing within.  Imp's snuffling
grunt came from beneath the door and he
opened it noisily and let the little terrier in.
As he did so he thought he heard a gentle
creak of Cockney's door.  He smiled into the
darkness and crept into bed, the dog curled
up at his feet.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
ONE MYSTERY LESS
</h3>

<p>
It was after nine the next morning when
Stamford's eyes opened on a world that
seemed out of focus.  He examined his
watch incredulously; the dink of breakfast
dishes and the rumble of lowered voices
convinced him that it was wrong, and he dressed
without hurry.
</p>

<p>
As he opened the door, the Professor, Isabel
and Mrs. Aikens were rising from the table.
The sitting-room clock told him that his watch
was right after all.
</p>

<p>
"These prairie nights seem too much for all
of us," said Isabel, in answer to his puzzled
look.
</p>

<p>
"Except our host," corrected her brother.
"He's been gone an hour."
</p>

<p>
"It <i>does</i> affect strangers that way," said
Mary Aikens, without looking up from the table
she was rearranging for Stamford's breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't that with me," explained Stamford.
"I didn't sleep well."
</p>

<p>
"The drive was too much for you," suggested
Mrs. Aikens.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Mr. Stamford had too successful
a day in town," laughed Isabel, watching
him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was successful," he replied, looking
straight at her.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they're serving stronger stuff than
they did a couple of weeks ago," hazarded the
Professor.  "By a chronometer that never
deceives, you've been in bed for the circle of
the clock.  My limit is eight hours.  Simple
mathematical progression in comparative
physical proportions would grant to Imp here the
whole twenty-four hours, and a mosquito would
overlap on the week after next and still be the
creditor of time.  But, lord knows, they never
sleep.  In the meantime some gently dead
but brutally fossilised Trachodon is kept waiting
beyond his preconceptions of Doomsday for the
resurrective hand of the Smithsonian Institute."
</p>

<p>
Stamford yawned frankly.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Professor, I'm not quite up to that
so early in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Some day," said Isabel, "Amos will have
had his say.  And the world will be so still
then."
</p>

<p>
"And so will science, and brilliant conversation&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Even our hostess is laughing at you," said
Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"Me?"  Mary Aikens was colouring.  "I&mdash;I
like this new life about the ranch.  I wish I
could keep you all&mdash;always."
</p>

<p>
Isabel leaned over and patted her hand, and
a tear was behind the smile.  Stamford,
uncomfortable at the display of emotion, changed the
subject.
</p>

<p>
"And so you've been exposing your sister
to that ford while I was away?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow," replied the Professor,
"when did you come to the conclusion that
Isabel was here for someone else's amusement
than mine?  Of course, Mrs. Aikens, if she
can be of real service to you here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The door had opened.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about Mary," Cockney broke
in harshly.  "Since Stamford and the <i>Journal</i>
let us down in the matter of help, we're getting
accustomed to doing our work ourselves.  At
any rate we haven't fallen to depending on
our guests.  Mary, where's the large pair of
wire-cutters?"
</p>

<p>
His wife loaded herself with dirty dishes and
started for the kitchen.  The Professor leaped
to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't disturb myself so much if I were
you," said Cockney in an even tone, so full of
meaning that the Professor turned aside through
the stair door without a word.
</p>

<p>
"We'll have to go now."  Isabel started to
follow her brother.  "The ford's perfectly safe,
Mr. Stamford," she threw over her shoulder.
"Anyway I can swim."
</p>

<p>
"What can't you do?  But you'd drown
trying to save that blundering brother of
yours."
</p>

<p>
"But he's a perfectly nice brother, don't you
think?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he snapped.  "I don't.  I wanted
you to come for a ride."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she called back from the stair
door.  "My next engagement's with Dakota,
I believe."
</p>

<p>
When the buckboard had disappeared round
the lower end of the corrals on the way to the
ford, Stamford, more than a little uncertain
of the wisdom of it, made for the stables in
search of some light on the previous night's
scene.  But no one was about, and he saddled
Hobbles and rode for an hour.
</p>

<p>
As he turned back, a solitary mess-wagon
came into sight far along the eastern trail.
Stamford's thoughts flew back to the cattle
shipping at Dunmore Junction, when the same
mess-wagon, at Dakota's command, drifted away
into the lonesome northern prairie, leaving a
half-dozen of its companions rattling off down
the trail for a night in Medicine Hat.
</p>

<p>
Stamford found himself wondering now, as
he had then.  He swung Hobbles off to the
south, and when the wagon had turned down
the slope to the ranch stables, he rode slowly
back to the crest of the slope.  The wagon had
just pulled up before the bunk-house.
</p>

<p>
The driver was lifting several rifles from the
wagon to carry them inside, the other cowboys,
who had returned while he was riding, looking
on.  Stamford's eyes gleamed with a sudden
revelation.
</p>

<p>
That lonesome mess-wagon of the H-Lazy
Z on the day of the double tragedy had concealed
the rifles the Police could not find.  Its
puzzling departure&mdash;Dakota's objection to
feeding Mary Aikens at the ranch mess-wagon&mdash;it
was all clear now.
</p>

<p>
Down the slope he could see Dakota, Bean
and several strange members of the outfit
watching him.  Whereupon he promptly fell
off, scrambled into the saddle again, and rode
in clinging to the horn.
</p>

<p>
"You're shore conside'ble of a horseman,"
chaffed Dakota.  "If I was you I'd patent
that style and sell it to a circus.  Barnum's
got clowns not half so funny."
</p>

<p>
"We're always funniest when we don't suspect
it," returned Stamford.  "I hope nobody will
tell you the truth about yourself, Dakota; it
would spoil things for the spectators."
</p>

<p>
Dakota forced the frown from his face with
a smile.  For some reason he preferred to be
friendly.
</p>

<p>
"You and me should mate up.  We could
put on a show for the ranch folks some night.
But you seem to be having fun without it.
We can hear you out here.  Say, that Bulkeley
gal shore can sing some, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford resented words and tone.
</p>

<p>
"It happens that she never sings."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's the only thing she don't do.
You don't mean to tell me it's the missus?"
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Aikens has done all the singing you've
heard."
</p>

<p>
"Holy Smoke!"  Dakota turned to his
companions.  "Think of that.  It's more'n a
year since she's opened that piano.  'Member
when she came first, boys?  Wasn't them fine
concerts she gave us?  Then she stopped.
Say, d'ye think, Mr. Stamford, they'd mind
if I drop around some night and just sit
quiet-like where I can hear and see?  Us punchers
don't get much chance with music, 'cept what
we make ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not the one to ask, Dakota.  But I don't
imagine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"By Samson!  I'll take the chance.  I don't
think I look so awful raw in them angoras, eh?
They cost me a handful of bucks in the days
when I was a gayer spark than I have time to
be these days.  It's about time I got something
back for my money."
</p>

<p>
And so that night, after the singing
commenced, Dakota sidled humbly to the open
door and stood outside the screen waiting to
be invited in.  Mary Aikens called to him.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds purty fine out there," he
apologised.  "It's a heap sight nicer close."
</p>

<p>
He carried a chair to the corner of the room,
clutching his Stetson nervously.  When
Stamford thought of him again he discovered him
deep in conversation with Isabel Bulkeley, a
wide grin on his face.  Stamford liked it so
little that he looked no more until Dakota
rose to leave.
</p>

<p>
The next day, after his morning ride on
Hobbles, Stamford had a lunch put up for him
and set out for the river to test the fishing.  A few
goldeyes fell to his rod in the first half-hour, and
after that he grew sleepy and leaned against a
rock.  Across the river the cliff towered raggedly
above him, its strata a confusing repetition
of lines that merged into monotonous chaos.
Great clefts, gorges and inclines cut the face
of it into a less inaccessible wall than it looked
at a distance.  He became interested.  He
dropped his pole and sauntered up the bank.
</p>

<p>
Reward came suddenly.  Through a fissure
in the cliff, that seemed to open into a wider
cleft further back, he caught a glimpse of a
familiar grey dress.  He was thankful then for
the idea that had struck him on his visit to
town&mdash;that he might find use for his pocket
field-glasses.
</p>

<p>
Isabel Bulkeley was seated on a ledge, her
back against a straight wall, her hands folded
idly in her lap.  Evidently she was dreaming,
though slight movements of her feet showed
she was not asleep.  The tools lay beside her,
and, though Stamford watched for almost an
hour, she did not use them.  Of the Professor
he saw nothing.  He returned thoughtfully to
his fishing, cast his line, and almost
immediately hooked a big pickerel.  Thereafter he
forgot for a time the very existence of the
Bulkeleys.
</p>

<p>
On his way to the ranch-house Imp darted
from the cook-house and fell in at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"At any rate," he said to his hostess, "I've
earned my feed to-day.  Four gold-eyes, one
real pickerel&mdash;and Imp."
</p>

<p>
"For the fish, thanks!" laughed Mary Aikens.
"But for Imp I fear we can lay the credit to
Dakota's absence more than to your attractions.
We're alone again on the ranch, and
even Imp, the traitor, finds the ranch house
preferable to a deserted cook-house.  No," she
scolded down at Imp, "I'm not prepared to
receive you into my heart on such short notice."  She
turned suddenly to her husband.  "Where
have Dakota and the others gone this time?"
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders.  "Don't ask
me.  My ignorance of ranching is notorious.
Ah&mdash;by the way, it's good we have friends
with us.  I'm going away myself for a few
days.  I want to see how the Circle-Arrow dogies
are standing the gaff.  They've been on the
ranges for two months now.  Next summer
I'm thinking of improving the strain from the
east....  You'll be all right with such brave
companions as the Professor&mdash;and Stamford."
</p>

<p>
A forced smile was scarcely wrinkling his
face.  Mary Aikens made no reply, but whistled
to Imp and went out to frolic on the little patch
of dry grass she had once fondly hoped to be
able to call a lawn.
</p>

<p>
Dinner over, Cockney rode away to the east.
They stood in the doorway and watched Pink
Eye race up the slope and sink out of sight over
the ridge.
</p>

<p>
"A wonderful man on a wonderful horse!"  Isabel
Bulkeley voiced the thoughts of them
all.
</p>

<p>
"And yet you've seen me on Hobbles!"
chided Stamford.
</p>

<p>
"That's why."  The Professor ducked beyond
reach.
</p>

<p>
"Pink Eye is as vicious on occasion as he is
powerful," said Mary.  "Cockney doesn't ride
him much, but when he does I know there's a
hard trip ahead."
</p>

<p>
That evening a strange silence brooded over
the valley; even the coyotes failed to greet
the falling darkness.  The Professor played a
little, but his fingers were lifeless, and, after
a few bars, he closed the piano and pulled his
chair before the door to stare into the night.
The women were busy with needlework; Stamford
smoked and thought.
</p>

<p>
Cockney's repeated absences, always
coinciding with those of Dakota and the others,
puzzled him.  His instincts refused still to link
the big rancher with the subterranean work in
which Stamford suspected the cowboys were
engaged, but&mdash;&mdash;  Stamford closed his lips
tight; he was there to prove Cockney's
innocence in the teeth of suspicion.
</p>

<p>
When he went to his room.  Imp shivered in
at his heels and curled up on the foot of the
bed.  Once during the night Stamford was
awakened by the dog's muffled bark, and
against the window he could see the ears
pointing stiffly out into the night.  Far away
a big pack of coyotes yelped, and, half-asleep,
Stamford followed their rapid passage along
the crest of the cliff across the river.  Yelps
and barks and howls burst out in a score of
places over the prairie.  Stamford reached
down to rub Imp's ears and sank to sleep.
</p>

<p>
It was three days before Cockney returned.
They were at the dinner table when they saw
him ride up to the stables, unsaddle, rub Pink
Eye down with straw, and lead him away to
the lower corral.
</p>

<p>
"Any of the boys back yet?" he asked, as
he joined them.
</p>

<p>
When they told him only the cookie was
about the place:
</p>

<p>
"Better keep quiet about where I've been.
Dakota's sensitive on the dogie question.  Every
year we fight about it.  He considers dogies
the blight of the West&mdash;that they lack more
in stamina and size than they make up in
quality of beef.  My idea is to improve the
quality, not only the bulk."
</p>

<p>
Stamford was watching him narrowly.  That
he was weary and hungry was evident, and
about his talk was an abstraction that belied
the seriousness of his subject.
</p>

<p>
"You have a few more ideas about ranching
than you care to show," he said.
</p>

<p>
Cockney served himself a third helping of
pork and beans and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Large men always wear masks," observed
Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"And small men are as transparent as water,
I suppose," complained Stamford indignantly.
</p>

<p>
Cockney was playing with his knife.  "Perhaps
Stamford knows he couldn't deceive if
he tried.  My personal experience of small men
is they're seldom up to what they wish to appear.
For instance, Stamford is physically broken.
Would anyone suspect it?  He seems to enjoy
the aimless life out here, yet in town he works
twelve hours a day with gusto.  There's nothing
to do about the Red Deer but loaf, yet he's
never indolent.  I don't try to understand
them."
</p>

<p>
He had resumed his eating, but Stamford
was uncomfortably conscious of more than
banter in his words.  Isabel spoke quickly:
</p>

<p>
"Anyone can see that Mr. Stamford's job
is to sleep&mdash;and doze&mdash;and sleep again."
</p>

<p>
"In order not to give offence&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't willingly give offence," she
broke in, with a laugh so indulgent that to
accept her words seriously would have been
impertinence.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd teach Mary how to say that,"
said Cockney.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," suggested the Professor merrily,
"she knows you better than Isabel does
Mr. Stamford."
</p>

<p>
"Too often guessing is mistaken for knowing,"
said Cockney, looking at his wife.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dakota and Bean returned early the next
morning, the others following in the afternoon.
The Professor greeted them with unaffected
pleasure as he returned from his day's work;
and after dinner he made his way to the cook-house.
Imp was already installed at the foreman's
feet.  Cockney lit a cigarette and wandered
off toward the corrals, and Mary called for Matana
and went for a wild ride, leaving Stamford
and Isabel to keep the ranch-house.  But
Dakota drifted across from the cook-house,
whereupon Stamford was quite certain that
henceforth they were bitter enemies.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Dakota developed such an annoying
habit of spending the evenings at the ranch-house
that Stamford's hatred of him assumed
enormous proportions.  The cowboy took to
daily shaving, and even Stamford was forced
to admit hitherto unsuspected traces of an
elemental comeliness.  When Isabel also seemed
conscious of it, he cursed beneath his breath
with a small man's jealousy.
</p>

<p>
Dakota responded to the poorly veiled dislike
in the safety of the cook-house, whither
Stamford repaired at every opportunity for the
purposes of his quest.
</p>

<p>
"You don't seem to like me, Dakota," smiled
Stamford.  He knew the memories it recalled.
</p>

<p>
"I always did hate dwarfs," snorted Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said Stamford, with mock
humility, "there was so much good left after
you were created that it wouldn't have been
fair to put it up in big bundles.  I must have
been turned out just after you were patched
together."
</p>

<p>
Dakota was not soothed by the loud guffaw
from his companions.
</p>

<p>
"Some day," he warned, "I'll get you
where we can talk it over real friendly-like.
Let me invite you over to Montana, where
the shooting's good."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  I'm safer here."
</p>

<p>
"You're dead right there, youngster," agreed
Dakota vehemently.
</p>

<p>
August was hastening to its end.  Stamford,
in a panic, began to realise how little he had
accomplished.  He was oppressed with the
depth of his inexperience, and at moments
considered seriously the wisdom of handing over
to the Police all the information he had collected
and getting back to his paper.  Though, the
longer he remained, the more he was impressed
with the mysterious undercurrent at the H-Lazy
Z, he had arrived no nearer the solution of the
murder of Corporal Faircloth.  His tentative
ventures to direct the conversation to
informative channels, whether with the cowboys or
with Cockney, were blocked by sullen silences
or suspicious glances; and it spurred him on
in his most discouraged moments, though it
told him nothing of value.  He knew he was
in the right place, but he was growing less
confident that he was the right man.
</p>

<p>
One day, having wandered far up the bank
of the river with fishing tackle in hand but
a keener intentness on the opposite cliffs where
he knew Isabel Bulkeley was working with
her brother, he saw, far to the south-west, a
galloping Policeman.  He mentioned it at the
dinner table.  Cockney bit off an oath in time
and expended his fury on his meat.  Professor
Bulkeley did not seem to hear, expressing a
regret that he had been denied an opportunity
of meeting "these fearless and sparkling
guardians of the law."
</p>

<p>
Cockney gave an audible sneer.
</p>

<p>
"You don't admire them, Mr. Aikens?"
</p>

<p>
"I hate them," Cockney exploded.  "If I
saw them driven into a corral and shot out of
hand&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jim, dear," Mary broke in gently.
</p>

<p>
His anger directed itself against her.  "Yes,
you've been swallowing the dope, like everyone
else.  You women!  You can't resist the
glamour of them.  But, for Heaven's sake, keep
it from me in my own house!  I won't have
it!"
</p>

<p>
He was almost shouting at the last, the very
unreasonableness of his outburst increasing
his anger.  Mary sat cowering a little before
it, and Professor Bulkeley rose abruptly and
disappeared upstairs.  Cockney's eyes followed
him in a sudden silence, then he, too, got up
and stumbled out.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens, returning in the early darkness
that night from a mad gallop on the prairie,
brought with her a bundle of papers handed
her by a rider from the Double Bar-O.  From
copies of the <i>Journal</i> Stamford learned that
the cattle-thieving was becoming bolder.
Evidently Smith was doing good work on the paper,
and the advertising was holding its own.
</p>

<p>
He went across to the cook-house, the Professor
strolling in later.  The Dude was induced
to bring out his guitar, and accompany himself
to one of the sentimental ditties of the Montana
saloons, the Professor proving himself possessed
of a remarkable ear for songs new to Stamford
and not in the tenor of Smithsonian Institute
circles.  There were several mouth-organs among
the outfit, and Bean Slade's high tenor was a
not unpleasing addition to the part-singing.
The Professor was so exuberantly delighted
with the entertainment that he went to the
door and whistled across to the ranch-house
for his sister.
</p>

<p>
She came immediately, laughing her way
into the group with the subtle touch of
companionship that always breathed from her.
Stamford immediately retired into his shell,
resenting her frank friendliness with these
rough fellows, resenting their half-shy
acceptance of it, resenting more intensely Dakota's
assumption that he represented the things
she liked about them.  Isabel looked at him
under her brows two or three times, with a sly
smile about her lips that did not add to his
good humour.  And presently, when she and
Dakota were talking and laughing together,
while the others went on with the desultory
entertainment, Stamford rose to leave.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Stamford," she called.  "Don't
leave the tenderfeet unprotected.  We're going
in a minute.  I was almost forgetting Mrs. Aikens."
</p>

<p>
She smiled on Dakota and the others, and
Dakota bowed low, hand on heart.  In his
enthusiasm he shook hands with the Bulkeleys,
omitting Stamford.  Bean's shy but inevitable
"Ta-ta" was quite as full of gratitude, and
Imp barked a farewell that, by his snuggling
wriggles against Dakota's legs, was meant to
say: "I appreciate the friendship of the ranch-house,
but it mustn't presume to interfere with
my <i>real</i> love."
</p>

<p>
"What fine fellows those chaps could be!"
muttered the Professor, on the way to the
ranch-house.
</p>

<p>
"They're that now," replied Stamford,&mdash;"except
Dakota."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
AN ADVENTURE IN THE MOONLIGHT
</h3>

<p>
Stamford climbed into bed with a feeling
of discomfort.  He always knew beforehand
when he would not sleep.  Even
as a youngster the aftermath of indigestible
luxuries, nightmare, was heralded before he
closed his eyes by a feeling of oppression.
To-night he longed for Imp's watchful ears
at the foot of his bed.  Outside, the world
was dominated by the hideous yelping of the
coyotes.  To Stamford they were a symbol of
Red Deer mysteries: though hundreds of them
by day lurked within the horizon, they were
seldom visible; at night, when only their
eyes could see, they filled the darkness with
raucous clamour.
</p>

<p>
For a long time he struggled in vain to
sleep, and at last put on his dressing-gown and
seated himself before the window.  The
mosquitoes had retreated before the cool nights,
though the sun still brought them to life in
clouds by day.  He removed the screen and
leaned from the window.  Beyond the shadow
of the house the prairie was yellow now with a
brilliant moonlight.
</p>

<p>
A distant sound of disjointed conversation
drew his eyes to the bunk-house.  A light still
burned there.
</p>

<p>
Urged by sudden recklessness, he hastily
donned part of his clothing and climbed outside.
</p>

<p>
He found the prairie in another of its moods.
To-night the moon blazed a spirit that ridiculed
the proportions of darkness and day.  It seemed
inconceivable that the slightest movement could
pass unnoticed in such brilliance, but this
that he looked on was a new world of silent
majesty.  There were the old landmarks, but
they were altered in size and distance and
relative location.  So plainly did the cliff
across the river stand out that it seemed within
a stone's throw, yet any attempt to decipher
the familiar strata, the recesses and projections,
was defeated by a bewilderingly new mass of
shadows and high-lights.  The ranch buildings
were crowding closer, and the lazy movements
of the horses in the corrals came sharp as pistol
shots.
</p>

<p>
Stamford stood for minutes, gripped in the
clutch of the prairie by moonlight.  His mind
refused to turn from the scene; he was restless,
unsatisfied, undecided.  The light was still
there in the bunk-house, and at intervals he
could hear the sound of voices.
</p>

<p>
Bringing himself back to realities by sheer
force of will, he moved round to the front of
the house, clinging to the shadows.  Where
they ended he paused a moment to fix in his
memory the concealing depressions that stretched
further up the slope toward the stables, and
then struck swiftly through the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
He was conscious of an ill-defined desire
to conceal his movements from the ranch-house
as well as from the bunk-house for which he
was making, and he sank to the first cover
with a sigh of relief.  After a careful inspection
in both directions through the long grass
he began to crawl forward.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer he approached the bunk-house,
though on a higher level, without having
once exposed himself&mdash;he was confident of
that.  The voices grew audible, certain excited
words coming to him, then phrases.  A wordy
quarrel was in progress, from which Bean
Slade's high-pitched voice projected itself
frequently.
</p>

<p>
Stamford moved nearer, crept over several
rolls to a hollow before the bunk-house, and
lay down to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Yah!" he heard General sneer.  "<i>You</i>'d
'a' let him go, <i>you</i> would, and got a bellyful
o' lead fer yore trouble, you would."
</p>

<p>
"There was other ways o' gettin' out of it,"
protested Bean shrilly, "besides doin' fer him.
It was damn brutal murder, I call it."
</p>

<p>
"Just 'cos <i>you</i> cain't sleep, Bean," jawed
Alkali, "don't mean yo need to growl the rest
of us awake everlastingly."
</p>

<p>
Dakota broke in imperatively:
</p>

<p>
"If you fellows don't shut your heads there's
going to be trouble.  Here you been on that
ole song, Bean, for the last hour.  What's
the good?  It can't be helped now.  Somebody
had to shoot&mdash;not to say it was meant to plug
him for keeps.  Now shut up both of you.
We got enough excitement ahead for a month
or so without worrying about a measly bullet
or two."
</p>

<p>
Stamford hugged the ground, scarcely
breathing.  Once more Dakota had blocked him.
Another minute and he would have heard
something of moment, he was certain, though
what it was he did not stop to consider until,
in obedience to Dakota's orders, the quarrel
ceased.  He was not sure then that it was a
case of any personal interest to him.
Someone had once shot someone.  All he knew
was that Bean resented it, and that General
was its strongest defender, whether as the
shooter or not was uncertain.
</p>

<p>
He knew of only three deaths by shooting
since he arrived: Corporal Faircloth, Kid
Loveridge, and Billy Windover.  Corporal
Faircloth's death was not involved, since there
could have been no danger of a bullet had he
been spared.  Kid Loveridge?  It was almost
as difficult to imagine that it concerned him,
since he was one of the outfit and its most
popular member.  Of Billy Windover's death
he knew too little, and was too little interested
to follow the connection.
</p>

<p>
The light went out; silence reigned in the
bunk-house.  But Stamford lay there, forgetting
where he was, riveting the conversation to
his memory for future reference.
</p>

<p>
A sharp, muffled bark from the bunk-house
roused him.  He raised his head cautiously
and peered through the grass.  That was the
precise warning the dog had given twice from
the foot of his bed.  What had disturbed it
this time?
</p>

<p>
The door of the bunk-house opened and Dakota
came stealthily but swiftly out, clad only in
his shirt.  In his hand was a rifle.
</p>

<p>
His first glance was toward the ranch-house,
but all the time he was moving rapidly to the
corner of the bunk-house, the rifle
half-poised.  Imp was there ahead of him, ears
cocked, looking off down the valley toward
the corrals.  Stamford sank into the grass.
</p>

<p>
A burst of flame startled him, and then the
crack of the rifle.  It, too, was pointing down
the slope toward the corrals.  Stamford forgot
caution and raised himself to look.  But he
could see nothing save the melting moonlight
that never fulfilled its promise of exposing
details.
</p>

<p>
Dakota returned to the bunk-house even more
quickly than he had come.  A few excited
whispers followed, and then silence once more.
Stamford began to work his way back to the
ranch-house, suddenly aware of how shivery
he was.
</p>

<p>
He had but started, his eyes searching the
line of retreat, when he saw Cockney, fully
dressed, appear from the shadows of the house,
pass into the moonlight-bathed side where
his bedroom window was, and climb through.
Stamford hurried on.  But before he reached
the point where he must cross the open, Cockney
reappeared and slunk into the shadows.  An
instant later Mary Aikens, in a dressing-gown,
clambered through the bedroom window and
crept timidly along the moonlit wall.  At
the corner she cautiously peered round after
her husband.
</p>

<p>
Stamford could see Cockney outlined against
the moonlit prairie beyond.  He was standing
with his face turned to the ranch buildings,
as motionless as the other shadows.  After
a moment or two, with sudden decision he
wheeled about and began to retrace his steps
in long strides.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens turned and ran for the window,
but she was too late, unless&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Stamford stood upright and spoke:
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear it, too, Cockney&mdash;the shot?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney stopped in his tracks, hand on hip.
And his wife disappeared over the window-sill.
Stamford stepped across the moonlight to the
shadow of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Stamford"&mdash;Cockney's voice was full of
menace, though it was quiet and low&mdash;"you'd
better not butt in."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure&mdash;&mdash;" Stamford recognised the
futility of talk.  "I heard the shot and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I've warned you," said Cockney, and entered
the house by the front door.
</p>

<p>
Stamford stumbled thoughtfully on to his
bedroom window.  He was throwing one leg
over the sill when Isabel Bulkeley spoke
suddenly from over his head.
</p>

<p>
"I was wrong, Mr. Stamford."
</p>

<p>
He was as much startled by her presence
there as by anything else that had happened
that night, and he did not reply until he was
safe in his room.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you frightened me, Miss Bulkeley,"
he gasped, leaning out to see her.
</p>

<p>
Her low laugh made him himself again.
</p>

<p>
"How <i>could</i> you be wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"You certainly do more than sleep&mdash;and
doze&mdash;and sleep again.  Here you're strolling
out when everyone else is asleep."
</p>

<p>
"It's very lonely," he hinted.
</p>

<p>
He felt that she was laughing in the silence
that followed.
</p>

<p>
"There are more reasonable hours for a
moonlight promenade than ten minutes to
one in the morning&mdash;even in <i>such</i> moonlight."
</p>

<p>
"Any hour of the moonlight will suit me,"
he said,&mdash;"if I'm not alone.  What wakened
you?"
</p>

<p>
"When two men stand outside one's window
quarrelling, a light sleeper is apt to waken."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you hear the rifle-shot?"
</p>

<p>
"Sh-sh!" she whispered.  "I think I hear
Amos.  If he wakens he'll not sleep for the
rest of the night.  And he must have his eight
hours.  Good-night, Mr. Stamford!"
</p>

<p>
The little man cursed the petty weaknesses
of the big brother.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Bulkeley!  Miss Bulkeley!"
</p>

<p>
But her window lowered, and he could hear
her move away.
</p>

<p>
With throbbing heart, unaccountably happy,
he threw off his clothes and crawled between
the sheets.  The clandestine good-night echoed
sweetly in his ears.  He could die like
that&mdash;&mdash;  But that was getting maudlin.  He pulled
up an extra covering and settled to sleep.
</p>

<p>
As in a dream he seemed to hear, far to the
west, the thud of a horse's hoofs.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
THE HOWL OF STRANGE DOGS
</h3>

<p>
Sleep trifled with him&mdash;beckoned him on,
only to elude him maddeningly.  He
spoke sternly to himself in language
favoured by the cowboys.  The fact was that he
was frightened, and he knew it.  A sense of
impending events held his body tense and his
ears strained.  Reasoning with himself that
it was only the result of the night's rapid
sequence of mysterious incidents did not calm
him.
</p>

<p>
For minutes he strained away to the west
after those strange hoof beats, only to relax,
disgusted at himself for yielding to the
imaginings of his tingling nerves.
</p>

<p>
From the direction of the bunk-house he
imagined he could hear at intervals Imp's
muffled bark&mdash;and then the gripping silences
of the most silent places in the world.
</p>

<p>
After a long time the coyotes gave tongue
again in their long, shuddering yaps.  Strange
how reassuring they were that night&mdash;that
hideous yelping that always before made him
shiver!  Stamford sank into a sense of
momentary security.  He slept.
</p>

<p>
He wakened to find himself seated upright
in bed, trembling, straining with eyes and ears.
Something terrible was happening outside.
Yet there was not a sound.  In a flash he
knew.  His sensitised ears were still echoing
with the comforting yelps of the coyotes, but
at the moment it was as silent as if not another
force but himself existed in all the world.  He
knew that he had wakened at the moment
when a great hand seemed to have gripped a
thousand wild throats to silence.  A hundred
times before he had heard the same uncanny
burst of silence.  But now&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
On his elbow he rested, scarcely breathing.
</p>

<p>
Outside&mdash;in the house&mdash;even down in the
corrals where several restless bronchos always
hitherto in these startling moments of peace
had spoken audibly of life, was a breathlessness
as strained as his own.  The world was
waiting&mdash;waiting.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly into the hush burst a solitary howl,
a shattering roar that seemed to mass all the
wild things of the prairie behind one tremendous
throat.
</p>

<p>
Stamford's blood ran tingling to his scalp.
Every muscle was tense against the inclination
to shut the awful thing from his ears.  And
as the howl pulsed through the listening night,
a second joined it.  Taking a deep breath,
Stamford bounded from the bed.
</p>

<p>
He knew that cry.  It was the night-baying
of huge dogs gone wild on the trail, of such
dogs as he had never seen.  Shivering before
the window, he listened.  They were running
swiftly across the prairie above the house,
drawing nearer and nearer, their clamour
shutting everything else from Stamford's mind.
What were they doing there?  Where were
they making for?
</p>

<p>
A commotion in the bunk-house brought his
eyes in that direction.  A pair of figures,
trailing saddles, flashed out and ran to the
corrals.  And even in their haste their
movements were furtive.  As they galloped madly
up the slope toward the oncoming dogs,
Stamford heard Dakota Fraley curse under his
breath.  The hoofs of the horses struck the
prairie at first with only the hiss of dead grass,
and then the thud-thud of distant galloping.
</p>

<p>
The dogs were coming fast from the upper
side of the house.  Stamford braced his trembling
legs, climbed through the window, and ran
to the back of the house where he could see the
slope upward to the prairie.  Yard by yard he
could follow their advance.  Almost as vividly
he pictured the rushing of Dakota and his
companion to meet them.  Half the world
then for Hobbles beneath him!
</p>

<p>
Across the broken howls cut Dakota's bellow,
and silence fell like a blow.  A few seconds
later came two sharp yelps of pain, and then
nothing more.
</p>

<p>
Stamford still stood in the cold night air, one
hand pressed against the wall of the house.
It was that hand warned him of movement
within the house.  With a vivid memory of
Cockney's warning only an hour before, he
darted back for his window.
</p>

<p>
As he turned the corner a flicker of movement
passed between him and the lighted prairie
beyond; but it was too quick to place.  Dragging
his fingers along the wall as he ran, his
hand struck something that gave before him.
Without stopping, he glanced upward.
</p>

<p>
A rope ladder was hanging from Professor
Bulkeley's window.
</p>

<p>
A crunch on the gravel walk before the
house sent Stamford on, scarcely pausing to
think.  Throwing himself over the window-sill,
he straightened up within his room and waited
in panting excitement.
</p>

<p>
Fear crowded him in&mdash;threatened to stifle
him.  Someone was out there before the house&mdash;his
ears told him that.  But a more thrilling
sense warned him that someone was in his
room&mdash;that if he but reached out his hand he
would touch a living body.
</p>

<p>
"Sh-sh!"  The low hiss from beside him
dissipated every element of personal fear.  "It's
Bulkeley!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford gasped.  Most prominent in the
medley of feelings gripping him was a desire to
laugh hysterically.  It was so like the big
innocent fellow to present himself like that,
as if they were meeting in a game of
hide-and-seek&mdash;nothing more.
</p>

<p>
"I'm f-frightened," came the stammering
whisper again, as the Professor's huge hand
fell on Stamford's arm.
</p>

<p>
The steps before the house moved lightly
round to the window.
</p>

<p>
"Are you awake, Mr. Stamford?"
</p>

<p>
Close to the house, just beyond range of the
window, Mary Aikens was standing, terrified,
pleading for companionship and comfort.  The
Professor's grip tightened so convulsively that
Stamford almost cried out.
</p>

<p>
She must have heard the movement.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Mr. Stamford, oh, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford wanted to take her in his arms and
comfort her like a big brother.
</p>

<p>
"It's only dogs, Mrs. Aikens&mdash;somebody's
dogs on a coyote or antelope trail."
</p>

<p>
He was trying to reassure her with his tone
even more than with his words.
</p>

<p>
"But it was so terrible&mdash;so threatening!"
</p>

<p>
"It's the way of dogs at night.  They're
apt to revert to type at an hour like this."  The
Professor's grip relaxed.  "To tell the
truth, I'm far more thrilled than I sound.
It reminds me of sheep-hunting dogs back
East."
</p>

<p>
A low sob broke from her.  At the same
instant the Professor hissed a warning.
</p>

<p>
"But there are no dogs on the Red Deer,"
she sobbed, "none like that."
</p>

<p>
"The night magnifies them.  But where's
your husband?"
</p>

<p>
"He went out&mdash;long ago&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A gruff voice from the corner of the house
stopped her with a gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, when you've finished your midnight
conversation with a man through his bedroom
window, we'll go to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jim!  I was frightened.  I couldn't
stay in there alone."  A double terror was in
her voice now.
</p>

<p>
Stamford ground his teeth in his impotence.
Cockney's big bulk loomed before the window.
</p>

<p>
"Go to bed," he ordered.  "I've something
to say to this fellow&mdash;right now."
</p>

<p>
She moved quickly before the moonlit square
of the window and threw her arms about the
big man.  Cockney made no resistance.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Jim, please.  Come to bed.  Can't
you see that I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Professor's lips were close to Stamford's
ear.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake get him away; he'll murder us."
</p>

<p>
Stamford stepped to the window.
</p>

<p>
"Cockney," he said, "whatever you think
of me is no reason for forgetting yourself.  I'll
be here in the morning."
</p>

<p>
The big rancher turned his head to look down
on the small figure of his pleading wife, took
her arm without a word, and started away.
Stamford stood listening as they crossed the
sitting-room and closed their bedroom door
behind them.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he demanded, turning on the Professor,
"perhaps you'll explain at least <i>one</i> of
the night's mysteries.  A little light might help."
</p>

<p>
He was fumbling about the dresser for the
matches.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, please!" pleaded the Professor.
"There might be others around.  I'll go back
to my room in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"First of all you'll explain why you're here."
</p>

<p>
In the darkness his five-feet-four was not
dwarfed by the extra foot or so of the
Professor, and the smaller man was in his own
room and had himself under better control.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid you'll&mdash;you'll laugh at me,
Mr. Stamford.  I have my&mdash;ah&mdash;little fancies.  We
all have.  I suppose I'm more sensitive to
ridicule."
</p>

<p>
"There's a good deal more of you to be
sensitive," Stamford sneered.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that's it.  Would it be&mdash;ah&mdash;too
much to beg of you not to insist?  You don't
suspect me of intentions on your purse, I
suppose.  As a matter of fact"&mdash;he giggled in a
silly way&mdash;"I was on my way to the furthest
corner under your bed when you came in."
</p>

<p>
"Considering the fact that I found you in my
room in the dark when you are supposed to be
in bed," persisted Stamford, "you'll agree
that not insisting is little likely to dismiss the
affair."
</p>

<p>
The Professor cleared his throat gently.
</p>

<p>
"I throw myself on your mercy, Mr. Stamford.
I don't believe you'll betray me.  When
a lad of eight my home was burnt down.  My
little dog, Tony, and a pet kitten went with it.
It was terrible to me.  The fear of fire has clung
to me ever since.  At home I always sleep
downstairs.  When I travel I carry a rope
ladder.  If you look you will see it dangling
now from my window."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Stamford drily, "I did notice it."
</p>

<p>
"I know it's disgustingly foolish, but&mdash;ah&mdash;I
was practising on it.  I've done it once or
twice before since we came.  And then those
awful dogs&mdash;or were they wolves?&mdash;completely
unnerved me.  I must have lost my head.
You see, I've always with me such valuable
papers on my work, the destruction of which
would be a loss to the whole nation&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't happen to be <i>my</i> nation,"
Stamford broke in coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stamford, can I trust you?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends."
</p>

<p>
"I was going to crave that you'd take the
responsibility of looking after my notes&mdash;in
this room."  He laughed apologetically, "In
case of fire they could be saved here."
</p>

<p>
Stamford had a sudden idea.
</p>

<p>
"And your sister&mdash;does she share your fears
and&mdash;and practise on the rope ladder?"
</p>

<p>
"Never, never!  Fear is a matter of mind,
and to Isabel is not that peculiar delicacy of
mind that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A slight scraping sound against the side of
the house stopped him.  There was a dull
thud on the ground, and Isabel Bulkeley came
swiftly before the window.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Stamford, I can't find my brother."  She
was almost as agitated as Mary Aikens
had been a few minutes before.  "He's not in
his room&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Here I am, Isabel."
</p>

<p>
The Professor stepped quickly to the window
and touched her on the arm.  She laughed, with
a tinge of hysteria none would have connected
with her.  Then the chaperone came uppermost.
</p>

<p>
"Amos Bulkeley, you come right to bed!
Don't you know you never could stand the
night air?  You'll catch your death of cold.
Is it any wonder, Mr. Stamford, that I lose
patience with him sometimes?  No, not a word,
Amos!  You march!"
</p>

<p>
And Amos marched as he was told, his long,
awkward legs struggling through the window
with ludicrous contortions.  Stamford, watching
with a smile in which was amusement and
contempt, saw him carefully place his feet in
the ladder rungs, test the ropes, and begin
to climb ponderously upward.
</p>

<p>
He could not resist the opportunity.  Isabel
was holding the ladder for her brother to ascend.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Bulkeley, I'm so glad you came to
me for help.  This is the second time I've seen
you to-night.  It's been a lovely night.  If ever
I can&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she whispered back.  "I'll
remember."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel, Isabel!"  The Professor was leaning
through his window.  "Come right along now.
I'll hold the ladder.  Don't be a bit afraid,
dear.  Nothing can happen.  Just close your
eyes and climb."
</p>

<p>
Stamford snarled up at the cooing voice.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
A CATCH OF MORE THAN FISH
</h3>

<p>
Long before the guests appeared at the
breakfast table next morning Cockney
was away on Pink Eye; so that there
was nothing to fear from him.  A singular and
confusing reticence was on them.  Several
times the Professor cleared his throat as if he
would speak of the things they were avoiding,
but he thought better of it each time and
continued his meal in silence.
</p>

<p>
Imp was there, slinking close to Mary's skirts
wherever she went, cowering, every bit of his
chirpy impudence gone.  His mistress reached
down and rubbed his ears.
</p>

<p>
"He leaped through my window this morning
and ran under the bed.  He would scarcely
come out.  If you'll tell me how I can keep
you, little fellow, I'm willing to try.  It's
home in a storm, isn't it?  Dakota doesn't
wear, does he?"
</p>

<p>
Imp waggled a lifeless tail and relapsed into
obscurity.
</p>

<p>
A heavy knock startled them, and Dakota
walked in.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Aikens here?"
</p>

<p>
"He went away early, Dakota&mdash;perhaps
across to the Double Bar-O.  I know he was
intending to see Mr. Gerard soon on business."
</p>

<p>
Dakota's eyes were roving about the room.
Imp tried to slink to the other side of the
concealing skirts, and Dakota's face lit up.  He
reached over and prodded the terrier with a
forefinger.
</p>

<p>
"Scared o' the wolves, little shaver, eh?
I don't wonder.  We don't hear 'em often up
here."
</p>

<p>
"Were they wolves?" asked Stamford, eager
to believe mere dogs had not so shattered his
nerves.
</p>

<p>
"Come down from the north, I guess,"
explained Dakota.
</p>

<p>
"But how could they cross the river?"
queried the Professor.  "They must have a
better ford than I use."
</p>

<p>
"Hm-m!  Perhaps they drifted up from
the Cypress Hills, or across from the west.
Maybe they smelt the little shaver here.  If
they ever got after him they'd shore peel the
bark offen him.  I'll be warning the boys to
keep a look-out on the calves.  I wouldn't
like to meet the beggars on the prairie without
a horse, no, not even with an arsenal on me.
They're dangerous devils."
</p>

<p>
"Isabel!"  The Professor was looking
anxiously at his sister.  "I guess we'd better
hasten our task.  This isn't safe for you.
Wolves!  Gr-r-r!  It sounds uncivilised."
</p>

<p>
Dakota shook his head gravely and left.  Imp
tagged humbly at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," the Professor grinned, "if there
are only the two we heard last night, I might
be able to satisfy them myself.  A couple of
hundred pounds ought to hold them for one
meal.  At any rate, I'd make a point of lying
so heavy on their innards that you'd have a
chance to escape, Isabel."
</p>

<p>
He looked out through the window to the
ranch buildings.  Dakota had picked up Imp
and was hurrying along with the little terrier
tucked under his arm.
</p>

<p>
"I think, Isabel, we'll try this side of the
river to-day.  That Monodonious skull can
wait another day.  It's managed to stick it
long enough to forgive another twenty-four
hours, don't you think?  I'll get the horses."
</p>

<p>
He lumbered off along the path to the stables,
calling as he passed the cook-house for a good
Samaritan to lend him a hand in deciding which
end of the harness went first on Gee-Gee.  Bean
Slade beat the Dude and General to it, while
the Professor watched proceedings as if it
were a new experience.
</p>

<p>
"Some day," he declared, "I'm going to
invent a harness that can be grafted on a horse
for a few generations until it's handed down
as part of his natural equipment, like teeth and
eyes.  I've a warm spot for tenderfeet&mdash;even
tenderfeet of ten centuries hence.  If I lived
that long I'd never forget my troubles with
Gee-Gee....  Hello, Dakota!  Teaching Imp
to ride?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota was in the saddle, with Imp still under
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Naw!  I'm taking him for his morning
constitooshunal.  He's changed his doctor, and
this one prescribes lots of exercise.  What Imp
needs is muscle; he's got gall enough for a
Great Dane."
</p>

<p>
The cowboys grinned, and Dakota chirruped
to his horse and moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you train him to hunt wolves?"
suggested the Professor.
</p>

<p>
Dakota threw him a quick glance over his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"By Samson, Prof., you've a head!  Alkali
'n' me'll perceed to take your advice&mdash;Alkali
'n' me 'n' the dread avenger o' the Red Deer,
Imp.  Wolfies, we're on your trail."
</p>

<p>
"If you'd wait a few minutes," said the
Professor, all excitement, "I'd like to join you.
To be able to tell my colleagues at the Institute
that I, the old-bone man, had hunted wolves&mdash;that
would be pride, indeed."
</p>

<p>
Dakota merely waved a refusal and trotted
away.
</p>

<p>
But the Professor picked up his sister at the
ranch-house and bumped away to the south-west
over the prairie in the direction Dakota
had taken, Isabel hanging to the low arm of
the seat with both hands.
</p>

<p>
Far out they descried Dakota and Alkali
riding in circles.  Imp was running about with
his nose to the ground.  The Professor shouted
and stood up in the buckboard to wave his arms.
But long before he was close enough to speak,
Imp yelped and struck off to the north-west
as fast as his little legs would carry him, Dakota
and Alkali spurring behind.
</p>

<p>
The Professor waved in vain for them to wait,
then turned the horses' heads to the north-east
and his day's work.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Stamford, left to his own resources
for the day, collected his fishing tackle and made
for the river.  He was not a fisherman, but
such fishing as the Red Deer afforded gave
him excuse for getting away where he could tell
himself without restraint what a fool he had
been to undertake his hopeless task.
</p>

<p>
In the shadow of a low cliff he baited his
hook and tossed it into the water.  A gold-eye
took it at once, and for a time he played with
it absent-mindedly, finally drawing it out,
removing it from the hook, and tossing it back.
Several more he treated in the same way, and
at last cast in his hook without troubling to
bait it.  The sun crept higher and beat
unmercifully on the bare rock, and he rolled a stone
on the end of the pole and stretched himself in
the shade.
</p>

<p>
"Don't seem ter be enj'yin' the fishin',"
gibed a high-pitched voice from the rocks
above, "or else yer too blame cosy."
</p>

<p>
Stamford raised his head lazily and surveyed
Bean Slade's unkempt figure perched on a
ledge over his head.
</p>

<p>
"Any fish that takes that hook's a born fool,"
he sighed.  "I don't want 'em any more than
they want me.  Come on down, Bean.  It's
far more fun to lie about and talk."
</p>

<p>
Bean climbed down and picked up the rod.
</p>

<p>
"Yu don't know no more about fishin', boss,
then yu do about&mdash;about lots o' things yu'd
like to know.  Gi' me that bait.  See that
smooth spot out there?  That's deep water.
Watch yer Uncle Ned."
</p>

<p>
He whirled the rod back and forward, and the
hook shot out to the centre of the deeper water.
Almost immediately the line tugged, jerked,
loosened, and went taut again.  Stamford leaped
to his feet and grabbed the pole.
</p>

<p>
"Hang to it, Bean!  There, we'll get it!
Whoop!  Gee, ain't he a fighter?"
</p>

<p>
Bean yielded up the rod with twinkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Fer a tenderfoot who don't fish, yu can
work up what looks mighty like a taste fer it."
</p>

<p>
He hung precariously over the water and
scooped unsuccessfully at a shining back that
showed for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Let 'er run, dang yu!  Let 'er run.  Yu
got to get 'er to shallow water."
</p>

<p>
After a struggle, in which Stamford objected
to assistance, but was unable to complete the
catch himself, Bean stepped into shallow water
and clutched the sturgeon.  Stamford looked
down on it with blazing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Mister Stamford," grinned Bean, "if yu
wasn't born a fisherman, yer shure goin' ter
die one."
</p>

<p>
"Bean," said Stamford, "I'll crave your
kind assistance to the extent of baiting that
hook again.  Then&mdash;no more.  I'll bring the
next fellow in myself or die in the attempt."
</p>

<p>
Stamford went back to the hole.  Nothing
happened.  He waited several minutes, yawned,
frowned, and leaned back against the rock.
</p>

<p>
"That one," he declared, pointing to the still
wriggling fish, "had this whole darn river to
itself.  My line says so."  He yawned again.
"Bean," suddenly, "you're my friend, aren't
you?"
</p>

<p>
The cowboy studied him curiously.  "I
reckon I ain't got no spite again yu&mdash;none of
us chaps at the cook-house have."
</p>

<p>
"Not including Dakota, of course."
</p>

<p>
Bean ruminated over that.  "Mebbe yer
right."
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe, Bean Slade, that you're
happy with that gang."
</p>

<p>
Bean got up and started away.
</p>

<p>
"Ta-ta!" he called.  "This ain't my
pumpin' day."
</p>

<p>
Stamford cursed his impetuosity.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he laughed.  "You've a brain
of your own&mdash;and I've seen no evidences of a
loose tongue in you.  I was going to tell you
something&mdash;perhaps&mdash;that was all."
</p>

<p>
Bean kicked over some loose stones and
wandered back.  Plainly he did not want to go.
</p>

<p>
And just then a fish took the bait.  Stamford
jumped forward, missed his footing, and tumbled
helplessly into the rushing current.
</p>

<p>
At the same instant a scream broke down
the river from the cliffs higher up.
</p>

<p>
Bean bounded to an overhanging rock, braced
his feet in a crevice and leaned far over.
Stamford came up almost beneath his hand, gasping,
already half drowned, surrendering to the icy
torrent that started in distant glaciers.  He
could not swim a stroke.  Bean's bony fingers
closed over his hair, stayed his progress, and
the other hand moved down to his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Here, yu noodle!" he shouted.  "Yu
got to help yerself, or I'll let yu go.  This ain't
no time to faint.  Grab my shoulders.  Now
work yer way up my body.  Yu'll find bones
thar to catch hold of.  Now&mdash;all together!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford lay panting on the rock.  Bean,
perspiration bursting from every pore, leaned
weakly on his elbow beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Whew!" he puffed.
</p>

<p>
That was all, but his limbs were shaking, and
the perspiration trickled down his neck and
dampened his loose neckerchief.  A great gush
of affection passed between the two men, though
neither spoke.  Stamford extended his hand
and laid it on Bean's, and the cowboy looked
away and drew a coloured bandana with his
free hand and rubbed it round his neck.
</p>

<p>
Presently he sat up and stared up the river.
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" he grunted.  "Yu shure don't
take a bath of'en, do yu?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that way&mdash;never again!" replied
Stamford fervently.
</p>

<p>
"Thought not."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cos there's such a funny noise when yu
strike the water."
</p>

<p>
Stamford flushed.  "Did I scream?"
</p>

<p>
"If 'twas you," grinned Bean, "yu shure
can throw yer voice high and far."
</p>

<p>
Stamford followed his eyes up the river cliff,
and flushed again, this time for a different
reason.
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw, Bean!  You were excited."
</p>

<p>
"Then there was two of us, I reckon."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I must have screamed," said
Stamford.  "I was never so scared in my life."  But
his heart sang with the knowledge that
Isabel Bulkeley, somewhere in the cliffs above,
had feared for him.
</p>

<p>
"All right, have it yer own way.  Only if
I was you I wouldn't believe myself."  He
drew several long breaths and looked shyly at
the man he had rescued.  "God, if I hadn't
been here!"
</p>

<p>
"Bean, I&mdash;&mdash;"  The surge of Stamford's
gratitude was choking him.
</p>

<p>
"Billy Windover saved me once like&mdash;like
that," said Bean, his eyes fixed on the foaming
water.
</p>

<p>
"Billy Windover?  Wasn't that the cowboy
who was shot down near the Cypress Hills a
couple of months ago?"
</p>

<p>
Bean nodded.  "Billy an' me was chums&mdash;the
best chums in the world, I guess, pretty
near.  Me and him was raised together&mdash;down
in Indiany.  Our farms was close together,
an' Billy an' me played Injun an' pirate an'
stage robber together when we was knee high
to a grasshopper....  We grew up together....
We loved the same gal....  He licked
me and won.  We fought it out on the banks
of a deep stream that cut through both farms&mdash;in
the woods&mdash;an' the licked one was to drown
himself....  He pulled me out...."
</p>

<p>
He lifted himself higher and drew one hand
angrily across his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"The gal she turned out bad ... and Billy
went a bit wild....  I went with Billy.  We
broke out in Montany.  Billy was a reckless
cuss, an' he got in bad with the sheriffs and
flitted over here.  I came as soon's I got the
chance....  And&mdash;and now he's&mdash;he's pulled
out an' left me&mdash;alone."
</p>

<p>
"He was murdered, I understand," said
Stamford.
</p>

<p>
Bean's face darkened, and his sunken eyes
glared.
</p>

<p>
"Damned sight wuss 'n that!  Shot down
without a chance in the dark.  Dirty cuss who
did it's goin' to settle with me."
</p>

<p>
"If you ever find who it was."
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;&mdash;"  Bean's eyes peered out furtively
beneath his shaggy brows, and he said no more.
</p>

<p>
Stamford led off on another tack; he had
learned all that interested him there.
</p>

<p>
"There's Kid Loveridge, too.  Someone shot
him, and he was one of this very outfit."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" growled Bean.  "The Kid got
what was comin' to him."
</p>

<p>
Stamford held himself under careful control.
</p>

<p>
"Then there's Corporal Faircloth."
</p>

<p>
Bean's lips closed, his face was inscrutable.
</p>

<p>
Presently he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yu thought a lot o' the Corporal?"
</p>

<p>
"He was my first and best friend in the
West."
</p>

<p>
"An' yer mighty consarned to find out who
shot him?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford did not reply immediately.  He
had a thought of throwing himself frankly on
Bean's affection.  It was certain that Bean
could tell him what he wished to know&mdash;much
more certain than that he would.  But the
three fruitless weeks of search on the H-Lazy Z
called for desperate measures.  He was
debating it when Bean spoke again in an ominous
tone.
</p>

<p>
"'Cos what yer doin' 's a mighty dangerous
game."
</p>

<p>
"Dangerous?  Do you know what I'm trying
to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm just givin' yu a warnin', boss, that's
all.  It's like to end at the business end of a
gun."
</p>

<p>
Stamford made a decision.
</p>

<p>
"The H-Lazy Z is crammed with mysteries.
If you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An' the less yu understand them the better
fer yer skin.  An' it shore ain't no business o'
yours."
</p>

<p>
"It is my business that my best friend was
murdered."
</p>

<p>
"Best leave that to the Police."
</p>

<p>
"But they're doing nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I guess ya don't know the Police," said
Bean, rolling a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
Stamford sat thinking.  "Bean," he said
suddenly, "I'm going to tell you something.
The night we returned from Medicine Hat I
got Hobbles out&mdash;never mind how&mdash;and rode
back to where we'd seen Dakota."
</p>

<p>
He waited in vain for a burst of surprise.
Bean merely nodded.
</p>

<p>
"They were branding or something.  They
almost caught me."
</p>

<p>
"Yer dead right there," agreed Bean.
</p>

<p>
In a flash Stamford understood.  "But it
couldn't have been <i>you</i> pushed me from
Hobbles."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!" grunted Bean, taking a long draw
at his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"You were back at the bunk-house.  I saw
you there an hour or so later, when Dakota
came in."
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh!  An' yu purty near gave the
show away&mdash;if Dakota's ears was as good as
mine....  Also Hobbles couldn't 'a' been out
at the branding neither, 'cos <i>she</i> was there in
the stable then, too, eh?"
</p>

<p>
He chuckled, and coughed with the smoke.
</p>

<p>
"But I heard you tell Dakota no one had
gone out&mdash;also I saw you start off right after
your supper to join Dakota; you promised him
to as we were driving in."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!  Did yu think yu wasn't intended
to see an' hear all that?  Ha!  Ha!"
</p>

<p>
"But I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Shure yu don't!  If yu did yu'd be back
in town now....  An' I'm not goin' to tell
yu, neither."
</p>

<p>
He got up, stretched, expectorated into the
river, and sauntered away.
</p>

<p>
"Ta-ta!" he called back.  "Take care o'
yerself."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
TWO PAIRS
</h3>

<p>
Stamford folded his fishing-rod, threw
his lunch strap over his shoulder, and
started back for the house, forgetting
the big sturgeon lying in the sun.  His clothes
were almost dry already with the warm rocks
and sun.  He had his first useful clue, and it
reassured him.  His guiding thought now was
that Bean Slade knew the murderer he was
after&mdash;and if Bean Slade, then the rest of the
H-Lazy Z outfit.  But how much or how little
was Cockney Aikens involved?
</p>

<p>
He was surprised to find the Bulkeleys already
returned to the ranch-house, though dinner
was a couple of hours away.  It delighted
him&mdash;and also blotted from his mind the success
of his afternoon's work.  What he recalled
was the scream Bean claimed to have heard.
He wanted to verify or disprove that.  With
a refreshed pride in himself he determined that
he <i>would</i>.  He proposed a walk; the brilliance
of the out-of-doors provided perpetual excuse
in the West.  Isabel's immediate reply was an
anxious look at her brother and Mary.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not asking your brother," he said
boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Amos and I have to work on his notes,"
she objected.  "That's why we came in early."
</p>

<p>
"Tut, tut!" protested her brother recklessly.
"I've changed my mind.  The inspiration is
lacking.  It's not my day for work.  I don't
care a hang if the entire carcass of a crested
Saurolophus is lost to the world by an afternoon's
indolence.  I'm&mdash;going&mdash;to be indolent!
There!  Whoopee!  Hear the cry of independence."
</p>

<p>
He lifted a foot and kicked the top of the
doorway with surprising ease.
</p>

<p>
"It sounds to me like revolution," said his
sister with mock severity, yet with more than
a little anxiety.
</p>

<p>
He picked her up and deposited her outside
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Trot along now, or Mr. Stamford may never
ask you again."
</p>

<p>
"Amos!"
</p>

<p>
He made a face at her from the doorway and
turned his back.
</p>

<p>
That her annoyance was not assumed Stamford
discovered to his embarrassment before
they had gone six paces.  Once she turned
about, to see the laughing faces of the Professor
and Mary Aikens regarding them from the
doorway.  For some minutes their progress was
wordless.  Stamford was puzzled by her
reluctance to leave the ranch-house, for he was
convinced that she wanted to come.  He knew
the wisdom of leaving her to break the silence,
of assuming humility, whether he felt it or not.
</p>

<p>
But he was not prepared for what she did say.
</p>

<p>
"We shouldn't, Mr. Stamford, we shouldn't."
</p>

<p>
He heard only the implied partnership, and
threw his shoulders back recklessly as he
tramped on.
</p>

<p>
"I don't care what we shouldn't do.  If it's
naughty it's nice.  That's how reckless I am."
</p>

<p>
Her smile was wan; some anxiety too deep
to respond to his banter was there.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like you serious," she said, "but&mdash;but
you <i>must</i> be now."  There was such innocent
candour in it that he knew he wanted
only to help her.  Always when he was feeling
most strongly the thrill of her presence, she
disarmed him by throwing herself on his mercy.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to be serious with you some time,
Miss Bulkeley," he said soberly.
</p>

<p>
She ignored the warning.
</p>

<p>
"It's about Amos."
</p>

<p>
"If Amos isn't big enough to leave alone, he
never will be.  Anyway, Mrs. Aikens will look
after him till we've had our walk.  Now I've
got you to myself, I'm going to keep you till
dinner-time."
</p>

<p>
She was laughing a little, but shaking her
head, as if to reprove him for trying to turn her
away from her troubles.
</p>

<p>
"We mustn't be selfish," she said slowly.
"Amos is big ... but he's not big enough, I
fear, to resist the&mdash;the most powerful thing in
life."
</p>

<p>
The alarm with which he searched her face
for a moment changed quickly to annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't possible to misunderstand you,
Miss Bulkeley, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She laid one hand on his arm, turning to him
her troubled eyes.  He stood still for fear she
would remove it.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you seen&mdash;haven't you suspected?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Bulkeley, I can answer for our hostess.
If you can say the same for your brother&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can, I can," she murmured brokenly.
"But love, you know&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know that, love or no love, there never
was a finer little woman than Mary Aikens.
Has your brother betrayed to you that he is
less of a gentleman?"
</p>

<p>
"I could trust Amos anywhere," she replied
simply.
</p>

<p>
"Then why not here?"
</p>

<p>
Her hands were clasping and unclasping as
they walked.
</p>

<p>
"This is so different.  I know what love can
do&mdash;how it can change things."  She was
stumbling over it, flushing as she spoke, but
continuing brave!
</p>

<p>
"I hope you do," he breathed.
</p>

<p>
But the tears brimming in her eyes made
him feel the brute for intruding his petty affairs
just then.
</p>

<p>
"Would your brother stay if he knew he was
exposing himself to a temptation he could not
resist?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
She considered the reply for a long time before
she made it.
</p>

<p>
"We can't leave, Mr. Stamford.  We have
our work to do&mdash;it's not mere personal pleasure
or satisfaction that forces Amos to continue
until he's completed his investigations.  It's
his duty to stay to the end&mdash;he can't help
himself."
</p>

<p>
He frowned.  "Please don't make me believe
you think digging up old bones a duty
that ignores&mdash;what you fear.  I hope you're
not that kind of a girl&mdash;I won't believe it."
</p>

<p>
She turned her face squarely to his, and for
several seconds they stood looking into each
other's eyes.  Her head was thrown back a
little proudly and reprovingly, and every barrier
of reserve was down.  Once more the utter
confidence in his manliness forced him to
control himself.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it," he said humbly.  "Only I don't
understand....  There's this to say for your
brother, that the husband of the woman you
fear your brother is learning to love doesn't
seem to be trying to hold her love.  I don't
understand Cockney Aikens.  I believe he's
white, but&mdash;but here we treat women differently."
</p>

<p>
"That's what started it, I think," she said
sadly.  "Amos pitied her&mdash;as you and I did....
And there are other things....  I can't
tell you all&mdash;everything that worries me."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's your duty&mdash;&mdash;"  He was about
to tell her that she should take her brother
away, but he was not unselfish enough for that.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," she replied, as if he had finished the
sentence.  "He wouldn't come&mdash;he couldn't."
</p>

<p>
They had turned back and were approaching
the ranch-house.
</p>

<p>
"May I&mdash;talk things over a little like this
with you when I'm worried, Mr. Stamford?"
</p>

<p>
Even as his heart leaped, he recognised the
subtle way she had armed herself against him
by the petition.  Never was he to permit himself
to take advantage of her confidence.  When
he would say to her the thing which he now
knew he would some day say, he must make
his own opening.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," he murmured.  "You may
say anything you like.  If I can help
you&mdash;that will be enough for me&mdash;now."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mary Aikens and Professor Bulkeley, left to
themselves, with cookie in the kitchen fussing
over the dinner, looked out to the sunlit silences
where the other two had gone, and responded
to their appeal.  They saw the two lovers
sauntering down toward the river, and they
chose the trail up the slope.  Slowly they
climbed the grade, saying nothing.  From the
cook-house door Imp thrust his nose, sniffed
with half-shut eyes into the drooping sun, and
decided that one of his half-formed barks befitted
the occasion.  Then, satisfied that he had done
all that could be expected of him, he trotted
back and lay on one of Dakota's feet.
</p>

<p>
The foreman was sneering through the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"The big boob!  He's shore on the wrong
trail there, and some sweet day the boss'll lay
hands on him and&mdash;piff!"  He made a movement
of tossing something away.
</p>

<p>
"An' the biggest boob on earth wouldn't
have no chance to earn it," growled Bean.
"Not with the missus."  When Dakota laughed
in his nasty way, Bean fired angrily: "An'
that little editor'll piff you"&mdash;he imitated
Dakota's gesture of a moment before&mdash;"if you
go gettin' funny with the other gal.  Anyone
can see where your eyes is."
</p>

<p>
He laughed and strolled outside to avoid the
explosion.
</p>

<p>
Up the trail, over the crest of the slope, the
two passed out of sight.  She plucked a handful
of grass from the centre ridge of the trail
between them and began thoughtfully to tear
it to pieces.  He moved at her side, his great
hands gripped behind him, his eyes on the rut
at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think they're getting fond of
each other?" he said after a long time.
</p>

<p>
A smile of loving sympathy made her face
so beautiful that he looked sharply away and
pointed to the vivid colourings of the sunset.
She followed his pointing finger absent-mindedly.
</p>

<p>
"It would be one of the few flawless matches,"
she said, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"They are all flawless&mdash;at first," he returned.
"Only some last a shorter time.  That's part
of life's misery, the legacy of original
sin&mdash;perhaps the worst....  Some pause to weigh
to the merest trifles&mdash;and lose their chance.
Some ... some don't pause enough.  The
secret of happy marriage, I'm convinced,
Mrs. Aikens, is a complete knowledge of the essentials
of each other's lives before the ceremony."
</p>

<p>
One handful of grass had been pulled to
pieces, and she seized another nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Few of us pause for that," she murmured.
</p>

<p>
"The agony of it!"  His hands were clasping
and unclasping behind his back, almost as
were his sister's on the other trail.  "And
ordinarily there is no way out.  Divorce doesn't
settle it.  The most righteous divorce laws
cannot supplant conscience&mdash;and conscience
speaks only in the one Book of all the world....
But this isn't becoming to such a night," he
broke in, with sudden eagerness.  "Look at
that sunset.  Only in the West do you find
that unbroken spectacle, such clearness of air,
such a wonderful sweep of colour.  What is it
about the Western air that makes a man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused abruptly, breathing heavily.  She
looked at him in quick fear.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;that makes a man feel ten years younger,"
he went on, with an absurd change of tone.
"I think I could grow frisky out here."
</p>

<p>
Across her face passed a grateful smile of
relief and understanding that she did not know
she made so plain.
</p>

<p>
"It's the essence of the West.  It makes or
mars a man.  It does the same, only more
swiftly, with the consumptives they send to
us from the East.  Some it cures&mdash;some it
kills....  Some it kills when it seems most
certainly to be curing them....  That's the
West; it does that with everyone&mdash;one never
knows."
</p>

<p>
He broke in on her dreamy reflections in a
lighter vein:
</p>

<p>
"Just the same it's the young man's country,
don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a great blessing&mdash;or a great curse....
What was Jim before he came here?"
</p>

<p>
It startled him; he had no reply ready.
</p>

<p>
"I fear Jim and I do not fulfil your estimate
of the foundation for a happy married life.  I
never knew his past&mdash;I don't now.  I never
knew his people&mdash;he never speaks of them.
I took Jim&mdash;for himself&mdash;a handsome, manly,
honest, good-natured&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The man at her side coughed, and she turned
to him with a wan smile.
</p>

<p>
"I know," she said wearily.  "You think I
shouldn't talk of my husband to others ... but
in all our married life I've never before had
anyone to talk <i>anything</i> with....  Jim and
I&mdash;Jim and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What I'm thinking, Mrs. Aikens," he interrupted
gravely, "is that I'm the last one to
whom you should speak of him."
</p>

<p>
She kept her eyes ahead of them on the dim
line of the sand buttes, and they walked on in
silence.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a cry burst from her lips.
</p>

<p>
"I must speak, I must.  My very heart is
eating away with the strain of silence.  I'll
go crazy with the worry of it.  It's about
him&mdash;Jim.  He's different&mdash;these days.  At
first&mdash;&mdash;  Don't think there's any chance of Jim
and me not&mdash;not sticking to each other.  I've
fought that out with myself already.  He's
changed, but I know what he <i>can</i> be&mdash;what he
was once ... what he won't let himself be
now.  Why?  I don't know.  Something&mdash;something
is crowding between us&mdash;crowding
harder and harder every day, I see him so
little now, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The big man squared his shoulders and
lifted his head.
</p>

<p>
"Mary Aikens, I'd do anything&mdash;pretty
nearly anything to help you.  You know that.
But I can't help you in this.  Please, please,
don't ask me&mdash;don't say another word about
him&mdash;not to <i>me</i>.  It doesn't seem heartless,
does it?  It's as far from that as&mdash;as black
from white.  You've a heavier burden to carry
than anyone I know ... and I don't know yet
how it can be relieved.  But it <i>will</i> be, it <i>will</i>
be.  I've that much faith in Providence.  I
shouldn't have said&mdash;that about marriage.  Had
you known&mdash;did you know all about him, you
would at least bear one less trouble than you
do, I'm sure of that.  If I were you I wouldn't
bother about that&mdash;not now.  You're his wife.
You should know whether he loved you once
or not.  And"&mdash;he ran his hand across his
forehead&mdash;"as an onlooker with eyes, I can
tell you that he loves you more than he ever did.
Is that enough....  I believe&mdash;at this moment&mdash;he
loves you better&mdash;better than you do him."
</p>

<p>
She gasped, and her hands tightened convulsively
over the grass she carried.
</p>

<p>
"I still love him," she said deliberately....
"I think I do.  What my love lacks is thrust
there by&mdash;by the wall he is slowly building
between us.  I think he loved me, yes, but&mdash;it
probably sounds foolish&mdash;I don't feel that he
wants me to love him&mdash;not too much.
He&mdash;sometimes seems to toss me aside&mdash;you've seen
it.  And Jim's not naturally brutal."
</p>

<p>
The Professor spoke with careless deliberation:
</p>

<p>
"His past is much easier to unravel than his
present.  You're most anxious about the latter.
I can see it&mdash;I see it every day.  You've
undertaken a lonesome task&mdash;it's the way a wife has
to, but it's as apt to mislead as enlighten.  I
don't believe that&mdash;that the wall is unscalable&mdash;or
at least the mortar's thin....
</p>

<p>
"And now," he started again lightly, "let's
enjoy that sunset.  I have only a few more of
them ahead, unless the winter holds off longer
than usual.  I'm not so bound up in my poking
about not to be sorry when I think of having
to give all this up."
</p>

<p>
They had been retracing their steps for some
time, at his wordless guiding, and were close
to the ridge before the drop to the valley.
</p>

<p>
"Never," he told her, "no, never, speak to
me again of your husband.  It won't lighten
your burden and it only increases mine.  Jim
Aikens may be maligned by circumstances
beyond his control, and we from the fringes are
so apt to misunderstand.  When I can help
you I'll give the signal.  Till then&mdash;but there
he is now&mdash;down in front of the house&mdash;waiting
for us."
</p>

<p>
Cockney was standing on the gravel walk,
every line grim and accusing.  His great legs
were apart, his arms were folded across his
chest, and he was staring at them under his
eyebrows in that thoughtful, disapproving way
of his.  They could read the angry tossing of
his mind far away.  Mary Aikens laughed
nervously.  The Professor bit his lip.  But before
they came within speaking distance, Cockney
wheeled away and disappeared into the house.
When they reached the sitting-room they could
hear his heavy striding in the bedroom beyond.
His wife trembled, started for the kitchen, then
changed her mind and passed into the bedroom
to him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a grateful relief to an oppressive dinner
when Dakota presented himself at the door.
A fire was burning in the sitting-room stove,
for the evenings were sometimes frosty now,
and the cowboy sank modestly into a chair
in the corner beside it.  Isabel, in an effort to
break the embarrassing silence, seated herself
near him.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you're finding all you came for,"
said Dakota pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Dakota.  My brother considers
the summer well spent indeed.  He still has
hopes of a more complete skeleton, but we can't
remain much longer, can we?"
</p>

<p>
Dakota scoffed.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't likely to be snow before November.
Sometimes we have a storm in September&mdash;mostly,
I guess&mdash;but it goes as quick as it
comes.  We're often out riding with the herds
into November.  It ain't just the weather you'd
want to be handling rock in, but you should
oughta see October here.  It's got creation
beat a mile.  Don't you go till October.
Besides," he added naïvely, "we got some hard
work for the next few weeks, and we can't be
home much."
</p>

<p>
"What indefatigable people you cowboys
are!" exclaimed the Professor.  "Sometimes
there seems nothing to do, and then it's night
and day for weeks."
</p>

<p>
"You're right there, Professor," Dakota
agreed in a loud voice.  "To make a ranch pay
like the H-Lazy Z is real hard work&mdash;though
Mr. Aikens there don't seem to think so.  And there
ain't many pays like the H-Lazy Z, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"What's that you said, Dakota?" asked
Cockney, coming out of his silence.  "Going
away for a few weeks?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and taking the outfit.  The fall clean-up.
We'll make the round o' the ranges and fix
things up a bit.  The Indians say we're in for
a breezer of a winter.  There's that Big Bone
Slough we got to fence on the north side&mdash;where
we lost all them cattle two winters ago.
I was saying to the visitors they needn't go for
another month anyway&mdash;till we're through all
that.  It's shore been a different place this
summer.  The Dude was saying that he never
got such joy from slicking up and changing his
shirt every week."
</p>

<p>
He grinned with them.  It was a long speech
to make in public, and he was proud of it.
The Professor bowed with a low sweep.
</p>

<p>
"I'm bowing for Mr. Stamford, too," he
chuckled.  "I can do it bigger than he can.
We appreciate, Mr. Fraley, the many courtesies
we have received from our fellow-countrymen.
But, no, that couldn't include the little editor;
he's only a local product.  He doesn't know
what it is to thrill to the stripes of Old Glory.
We'll always remember you.  We hope you'll
have equal cause to remember us."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Professor," Dakota replied,
with an expansive sweep of his hand.  "We're
shore pleased punchers."
</p>

<p>
And having delivered himself with credit to
himself and his friends, he backed out, bowing,
his angora chaps ruffling in the wind as he
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
His companions greeted him at the bunk-house
with eager grins.
</p>

<p>
"Did she give yer a scented hanky to wear
nex' yore heart, ole hoss?" enquired General
confidentially.
</p>

<p>
"Or a kiss on the forehead an' promise to be
a sister to yo?" put in Alkali sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you fellers ain't familiar with the
symptoms," said Muck.  "Dakota's planned
ter 'lope, an' he ain't got his checks cashed."
</p>

<p>
"G&mdash;!  I wish I had," muttered Dakota,
with sudden fervour.  "I'll shore be devilish
glad when we get this bunch offen our hands
and the equiv in our jeans.  I got a spooky
feeling about the whole biz.  It's a big bunch
to get down across the railway and over fifty
miles more to the border.  And it'll be a
deuced sight bigger when the next lot's run in....
But we got to do it.  That S-Bar-I outfit'll
give us a run for our money.  But that's all to
the hunky.  Got your shooting irons o.k.,
boys?"
</p>

<p>
He shifted his eyes slowly to Bean Slade's
thin body outstretched on a bunk, his hands
beneath his head.
</p>

<p>
"Bean's funking," he sneered.
</p>

<p>
Bean lifted an angry head.  "Bean Slade's
got himself in this thing with both feet, you
son-of-a-gun, an' he'll stick....  Just the same,
the old H-Lazy-Z outfit's goin' to bust up this
winter.  This li'l boy's strikin' back fer
civilisation&mdash;whatever that means."
</p>

<p>
Imp, resting against Dakota's foot, raised his
sharp ears and grunted.  In a couple of bounds
Dakota had the door open.  Professor Bulkeley
stood outside, blinking and smiling through his
spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you haven't retired, friends,"
he chattered.  "I couldn't let you go without
a record of the pleasant associations with my
estimable and cheery countrymen of the H-Lazy
Z.  Will you do me the honour of inscribing
your names in this little book?  My sister and
I will look at it for many a year in remembrance
of you when we're far away."
</p>

<p>
He stumbled over the step, a notebook in
one hand, fountain pen in the other.  Dakota
laughed harshly.
</p>

<p>
"Here, trot up, you low-born Yanks, and
scrawl your nom-de's for the everlasting records
of the li'l country God made without desecrating
it with Mounted Police.  Let's make it our
second papers o' repatriation.  Hurrah for
Old Glory&mdash;and Professor Bulkeley and his
charming and beautiful sister!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor pompously cleared his throat.
</p>

<p>
"On behalf of myself and my sister, on
behalf of the country we love and respect, I
thank you.  Ever enthroned in our hearts will
be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ya-as," yawned Alkali, "so they say.
Le's take the rest for granted.  Sounds like
Decoration Day&mdash;an' sort o' makes me lonesome.
An' I don't cry pretty."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind Alkali," apologised Bean Slade.
"He allus did get maudlin easy.  There's my
scribble&mdash;Albert Shaw, better&mdash;or worse&mdash;known
as Bean Slade ... so my mother won't
rekernise me when I get mine in the way I'm
shure to get it.  Fust time I've wrote it fer
eight years....  Last fer the rest o' my
nacherl days, so help me!"
</p>

<p>
He tossed the book across the table.  The
Professor picked it up with a beaming smile and
bowed himself out.
</p>

<p>
"Ta-ta!" Bean called after him.
</p>

<p>
"The sneaking old geezer!" growled Dakota,
when the heavy steps had faded into the darkness.
"If it ud been anyone else there'd 'a'
been shooting, I tell you&mdash;that Stamford
peanut, for instance.  I don't like the look of
his ratty eyes.  He's just the kind o' unlikely
chap ud be working for the Police&mdash;if he had
a foot more on him.  Now turn in, boys.
To-morrow's the last round-up for the big vamoose
to God's country&mdash;and then gold enough to
drown ourselves.  Bean, hang on for another
year or two, and I'll be damnified if I don't
flit with you.  It's a bit too creepy for me off
here at the edge of nowhere."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
THE SECRET VALLEY
</h3>

<p>
Morton Stamford may not have
been a sick man when he arrived
at the H-Lazy Z ranch; he was at
least a stronger man at the end of his month's
stay.  His riding he continued only as
practice, always with the thought that he might
require it.  But he walked more, diving out
of sight daily into the chaos of the river banks,
there to piece together his clues and plan new
attacks on the problem he was working into
shape for presentation to the Mounted Police.
</p>

<p>
Also he now and then caught sight of Isabel
Bulkeley on the other cliff, and that in itself
was reward enough.
</p>

<p>
As the days passed he felt a new thrill in
his veins, a virility that clamoured for physical
exertion, and his walks extended further and
further along the river, a lunch strapped over
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Eastward the south bank often fell to an
uninteresting flatness, lined still by the
grass-covered trails of the buffalo herds of
comparatively recent years.  Westward it was different.
There the prairie level dropped to the river in
one great leap, confining the current sometimes
between high cliffs, sometimes with steep rocky
wall on one side and an almost inaccessible valley
on the other to the foot of the opposite cliff.
It was a canyon of varying tightness, but always
a canyon, the water dashing down here and
there with frothy roar, everywhere with a
force and depth that defied fording.  The
glamour of its fury appealed more and more as
he tramped further up-stream.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds of miles still to the west, in the
foothills of the Rockies, the main branch was
a glacier torrent that rolled onward through
uninhabited wilds until it cut the Calgary-Edmonton
line of homesteaders at the village
of Red Deer.  Thereafter it dived once more
into the unknown, never once touching the
haunts of men until it reached the H-Lazy Z.
</p>

<p>
Stamford used to sit overlooking the torrent,
picturing that long trail in the wilderness,
where thousands of years ago great animals had
been covered by the earth's convulsions.  His
uncontrolled imagination knit fantastic stories
about them, and the fettered life of the little
man longed to break into the heart of it and
listen to its tale before soulless man tamed it.
</p>

<p>
One day he found himself far above any point
he had reached before.  He had clung to the
top of the cliff, stopping only here and there
to peer over the precipice to the water's edge,
and his progress had been faster than he realised.
Amid scenes new and vastly interesting he
munched his lunch.  Below him the face of
the cliff was rent by huge fissures and lined
with ledges, and the river valley spread and
narrowed in infinite variety.  Across the river
the hitherto unbroken height showed signs of
relenting, and great dips almost approached
the nature of valleys.
</p>

<p>
Uncertain how far he had come, he was about
to turn back, when a sudden noise sent him
crouching to the upper rocks.  It was the
barking of huge dogs.  At the first note he
recognised them.  He wondered if they had
seen him, and he peered carefully out.  The
dogs were on the other side of the river, higher
up.
</p>

<p>
He began to creep toward them, the condition
of the cliffs favouring him.  Gradually he
sank lower and lower toward the river.  He
did not dare look out.  With an instinctive
anxiety he did not stop to analyse, he felt that
other eyes were there; also he dreaded some
unthrilling explanation for the thing that was
thrilling him.
</p>

<p>
When at last the clamour told him that he
had come far enough, he raised his head to
an opening in the rocks and looked.
</p>

<p>
Across from him, partially hidden by a line
of slender crags at the river edge, was a beautiful
valley, a low-lying patch of verdant meadow
as different from the dead wastes above as a
garden from a wilderness.  Almost half a mile
long by four hundred yards deep, it was backed
by a straight wall of cliff, broken only by two
ledges.  Several tiny waterfalls tumbled from
the face of the cliff, splashing to the upper ledge,
where they joined and widened for the plunge
to the meadow below.
</p>

<p>
In that deserted country the Red Deer had
scooped out for its own amusement a veritable
oasis, and enclosed it with unscalable
walls.
</p>

<p>
That was Stamford's fleeting idea.  But several
flaws chased the romantic thought away.  The
valley was neither reserved for the amusement
of the river, nor was it inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
A herd of cattle was browsing in the succulent
grass.  To the east the cliff sloped away behind
the obtruding crags.  There undoubtedly was
the entrance.  And with his field-glasses
Stamford picked out on the lower ledge a rude shack
that, to the bare eye, merged in the general
greyness of the background.
</p>

<p>
Nothing else of life could he find, though the
valley was only a few hundred yards from him.
Then where were the dogs?  And where were
dogs must be humans.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the barking broke out afresh, and
two great dogs burst from behind a concealing
rock, their noses pointing upward to the slope
at the eastern end of the valley.  Stamford
swept his glasses all about, but for a time saw
nothing to focus the clamour.
</p>

<p>
Then, climbing along the higher levels beyond
the reach of the dogs, came into view the big
form of Cockney Aikens.
</p>

<p>
In and out among the rocks Cockney moved,
now visible, now hidden from view, examining
every rock, every foothold; climbing downward,
the dogs seeming to tear themselves to pieces
to get at him.  He lifted himself to the top
of a rock and stood looking across the valley
at the cattle, ignoring the canine protest.  Then,
as if startled, he leaped out of sight and did
not reappear.  The barks rumbled away to
grunts and growls, and presently the dogs
returned to the lower level.
</p>

<p>
Stamford was still watching with fascination
their slinking muscular movements, when one of
them raised his head to the top of the cliff and
growled, and in a moment both were filling the
valley with their disturbing din.
</p>

<p>
The field-glasses were turned on the top of
the cliff.  A man's head came slowly in sight
and peered over.  Then a long rope dropped
away, and, hand over hand, the man descended
rapidly to the upper ledge&mdash;sixty feet of descent
without a pause.
</p>

<p>
So absorbed was the watcher in the remarkable
grace and muscle of the descent, that he
did not at first recognise this second visitor to
the valley.  When he did he rubbed his eyes,
directed his glasses again, and gasped.
</p>

<p>
Professor Bulkeley!
</p>

<p>
The big man walked fearlessly along the narrow
ledge, a hundred feet above the valley,
disappeared from Stamford's sight, and after a time
came into view again on the lower ledge.  The
dogs bounded up rude steps cut in the rock
before the shack, welcoming him with waving
tails and whimpering barks.  He stooped to
rub their ears, then at a word they quieted
and fell in at his heels as he dropped to the
valley.  A second command sent them to their
stomachs, while the Professor advanced slowly
toward the cattle.  The nearer ones raised their
heads from the long grass and examined him
suspiciously, but he stood still, and they returned
to their feeding.  Slowly the Professor moved
round the herd, eyeing them from every angle.
After a time he came down to the water's edge
and looked up and down the river, intently
examining the opposite cliff.
</p>

<p>
Stamford lay motionless, only his eyes showing.
</p>

<p>
Whistling to the dogs, the Professor went
off to the eastern side of the valley and began
to pick his way upward, peering about him
as Cockney had done.  On the very rock
where Cockney had stood he paused a long
time, looking across the valley and all about
at his back.  Below, the dogs watched him
with clumsily wagging tails.  When next he
came into sight it was on the ledge beside the
shack.  This he skirted back and forward
but did not enter.  Then, with a farewell pat
to the dogs, he disappeared the way he had
come and came out on the upper ledge.
</p>

<p>
Hand over hand he went up the rope almost
as rapidly as he had descended a half-hour
before, and a few seconds later two lolling
dogs and a herd of feeding cattle were the only
life in the valley.
</p>

<p>
Stamford lay where he was for a long time.
He had no hope of seeing more that day, but
he did not wish to be seen.  The dogs lay
on the lower edge, their heads outstretched
on their paws.  Below them contented steers
sank their noses into such grass as they had
never before eaten, and drank from sparkling
streams that were nectar to their alkali-parched
throats.  A heavy-footed farmer might have
issued from the unsightly shack and whistled
lazily to the dogs to fetch the cows for milking.
</p>

<p>
Stamford smiled at the fancy.
</p>

<p>
Thoughtfully he retraced his steps under
cover of the jagged cliff for almost a mile,
where he emerged on the prairie and made
swiftly for home.
</p>

<p>
He was late for dinner, but they were holding
it for him.  Cockney had not returned.
</p>

<p>
"Deep down in my innards," protested the
Professor, with mock displeasure, "I've an
irresistible impulse to be nasty.  I'd like to
think it righteous indignation&mdash;but it may be
only hunger.  At any rate, here goes: Anyone
who can delay a meal in this boarding-house
should have his rates raised.  He insults the
fare&mdash;as well as the f-a-i-r."  He bowed to
their hostess.
</p>

<p>
"I nearly lost myself," apologised
Stamford.  "Deep down in my innards is only
hunger; and I'm not going to make it an
excuse for mushy compliments.  I'll leave
contrition until I've satisfied my hunger."
</p>

<p>
"Indigestion is the most likely result,"
laughed the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Were you really lost?" asked Isabel
anxiously.  "You know how dangerous&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Isabel Bulkeley"&mdash;the Professor was shaking
a stern finger at her&mdash;"I refuse to share
your anxiety with Mr. Stamford."
</p>

<p>
"Having made such a failure of mothering
you," she retorted, flushing, "I'm inclined to
transfer my anxiety."
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't really lost," Stamford assured her,
"for I stuck to the river-bank.  But I've been
further than I ever was before&mdash;many miles
to the west."
</p>

<p>
He regarded the Professor significantly as he
said it.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, went far afield," returned the
Professor mysteriously.  "And I found promising
signs.  But before I say more I want to be
certain; it's disappointing to hope too much.
It's very interesting up there, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is&mdash;very," Stamford replied into his
soup-spoon.
</p>

<p>
All evening the Professor was plainly trying
to get a word alone with him, but Stamford
had no wish to be questioned, and he gave no
opportunity.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
THE RAFT IN THE CANYON
</h3>

<p>
Next morning Stamford started off the
instant breakfast was over, but he
did not go further than the cook-house.
He found it deserted, the outfit having
departed the day before on what promised to
be a three or four days' expedition.  Stamford
poked about the cook-house and bunk-house
with a vague idea of coming on clues left carelessly
exposed.  In the midst of it the Professor
walked in on him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought you were gone for the day,"
said the Professor, "and I hoped our friends
of the funny names might be back."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going now," Stamford returned shortly,
and walked away, though the Professor called
to him.
</p>

<p>
From among the rocks on the river-bank
he saw the buckboard pass around the corrals
and make for the ford.  He followed.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere that herd of cattle in the little
valley had crossed the river, and he was
determined to discover where.  He had rather
definite ideas about them that led him to expect
no information from the ford.
</p>

<p>
In that he quickly proved himself right.  He
had seen, even from where he lay on the opposite
cliff, that most of the cattle had been in the
valley a long time; that was evident from their
plumpness and undisturbed feeding.  The more
recent arrivals were betrayed by their rougher
coats and leaner bodies, and by a wilder fling
of the head when the Professor approached
them.  There had been no rain on the Red
Deer in two months; their tracks, were there
any, would show plainly enough in the mud
approaches to the ford.
</p>

<p>
But there was nothing there save the hoof-marks
of the Professor's team and a few dim
old hollows that must have been there from
the spring.
</p>

<p>
He considered the possibility of a ford further
east, but one near enough to be of use to the
valley he would have heard of.
</p>

<p>
Carefully examining the shore as he went,
he turned back to the west.  Now and then
he stopped to scrutinise the face of the opposite
cliff for marks of a slope on that side.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the end of the lowest corral he
raised himself on a rounded rock to look about
him.  Across the river was unbroken wall.
On this side was a stretch of tumbled erosions
that cut off his view from the ground.  As
he let himself down again his foot slipped and
he fell, feet first, between two rocks.  He was
surprised to hear the crunch of leather, and,
looking where his feet had gone, he saw a saddle
carefully hidden, and beneath it a bridle.
More surprising, it was not a stock saddle but
an English pattern of the softest, lightest
kind, ridiculously small and compact&mdash;so small
that a man's coat would almost hide it.
</p>

<p>
He thrust it back and went hastily on.  His
eyes flitted instinctively to the ranch-house,
and just then the cook came from the kitchen
and emptied a pot.  Stamford ducked, though
a score of heads would pass unnoticed in that
jumble of rock at such a distance.
</p>

<p>
Keeping to the river-bed, he moved up-stream
and presently the cliffs beside him rose to the
level of their mates on the other side.  But
there was always room for him to advance.
At places the walls narrowed, the current
rushing between with indescribable fury, and
widening below in eddying sullenness that
was almost as terrifying.  That it did not
always chafe its barriers in vain was shown
by the tumbled confusion everywhere.
</p>

<p>
In a few places deep crevices ran down from
the prairie, and these Stamford examined
carefully.  But there was no sign of a ford.
Equally alive was he to movement on the
opposite cliff.  By lunch-time his clothes were
showing marks of his tireless clambering.
</p>

<p>
Below him&mdash;during the last half-hour he
had been rising on the face of the cliff&mdash;a
comfortable ledge invited, and he climbed
down and unslung his lunch.  As he ate he
realised how easy had been his descent.  Out
before him extended a level floor of rock
up-stream; behind, a steep incline ran upward,
disappearing around a bulge in the rocky
face.  Stamford knew cattle would not follow
such a steep ledge at such a height.  Below,
the water ran smooth, but tiny whirlpools
covered its surface; the current beneath was
swift and treacherous.
</p>

<p>
He ate absent-mindedly, puzzled by the clear
ledge ahead, while elsewhere was such a chaos
of fallen boulders.  With the last mouthful
he retraced his steps, searching for some branching
path to the prairie above.  He found it in
a draw that left at right angles the one he had
followed down&mdash;an easy, grass-floored ascent.
Tangling and twisting, he reached the prairie.
</p>

<p>
In its depths were unmistakable evidences of
cattle.
</p>

<p>
He returned to the lower level and followed
it to its end.  Gently it fell to the level of the
river; abruptly it ended in a wide platform of
rock that extended in under the cliff for fifty
feet or more.  On all sides but the way he had
come was towering rock only a bird could
pass.
</p>

<p>
Nonplussed, irritated by the dashing of his
hopes, he poked about.  The bare rock all
round could conceal nothing, and ten yards
ahead was the certain end.  Yet at his feet
were the marks of cattle.  He moved nearer
the end of the platform and leaned against a
pinnacle that projected from the water.  As he
turned helplessly to the opposite side of the
river, the solution lay before his eyes, the one
thing he had never suspected.
</p>

<p>
A heavy raft lay tight against the pinnacle
on which he leaned, protected from the rush
of water above by another jutting rock.
</p>

<p>
He approached it with incredulity.  Quiet
as the stream looked superficially just there,
he knew no motive power applicable at such
a place would breast that current.  And clearly
it was too deep and swift to pole.  In vain he
examined the overhanging cliffs for wire.
</p>

<p>
At the very end of the ledge he caught sight
of an end of cable wound round a rock.  Through
his field-glasses he traced its exit across the
river.  But still the method of passage was
obscure, for the cable stretched beneath the
torrent, as did the wire that connected it with
the raft.  Studying then the angle of the raft to
the current, he realised that the same principle
prevailed here as propelled the ferry across the
South Saskatchewan at Medicine Hat.
</p>

<p>
It was surprisingly simple, yet he had nowhere
else seen it in practice.  A wire extended from
either end of the raft to the cross-river cable,
the shortening of the front one of which, together
with the extension of the rear one, forced the
current itself, urging against the angled side
of the raft, to be the propelling power.
</p>

<p>
A burden lifted from Stamford's mind.  Here
was the crossing of the herds to the hidden
valley....  Here, too, was the means by
which the dogs&mdash;somehow unknown to Dakota
and his comrades&mdash;were brought from the
valley and turned loose on the prairie on that
memorable night.
</p>

<p>
He caught himself whistling, until he realised
that no part of his discovery assisted him to
the solution of his own problem.
</p>

<p>
A feeling of discomfort had been increasing
for some time, and he decided that he was
under observation.  Clambering nonchalantly
to his feet, he retired to the cover of the pinnacle
that concealed the raft from below, and seated
himself behind it.  After a time his curiosity
overcame him.  Turning on his knees he
slowly advanced his head to look across the
river.
</p>

<p>
As his eyes came over the edge of the bank
he saw an end of wire protruding from a small
pile of rock close to the water's edge.  It
extended out into the river and disappeared.
He knew by its position that it was intended
to be concealed even from those who commonly
used the raft.  The action of the current had
worked the end from its covering of stones.
He drew back without touching it.
</p>

<p>
At the end of an hour he decided to
brave the eyes he knew were still on the
watch.
</p>

<p>
Again he was late for dinner, but from a
distance he saw the Professor and his sister
drive rapidly up to the ranch-house.  They,
too, were late.
</p>

<p>
"Really," the Professor chided, trying to
induce a frown to gather on his placid forehead,
"your continued indignity in the matter of
eats is a subject for solemn consideration."
</p>

<p>
"I am at a disadvantage," returned Stamford.
"I have no team to hustle me and my
discoveries home at night.  With Gee-Gee and
his fellow a good driver could, I am sure, cover
from five miles up the other side of the river,
and cross the ford, in the time it would take
me to walk it on this side.  With an
exceptional driver I'd lose miserably."
</p>

<p>
"Some day," proposed the Professor genially,
"we'll try it.  I'm growing quite conceited
over my mastery of the incorrigible Gee-Gee.
I won't always be so busy as I am now."
</p>

<p>
"If that day delays, you'll never be able
to get to town the mountain of button material
collecting at the back door."
</p>

<p>
"Always," returned the Professor gravely,
"I'm looking for something bigger.  That
discovery I hinted at last night&mdash;&mdash;  You
wait, you cold-blooded editor.  We palæontologists
may be denied some thrills, but at least
when we make mistakes there's no libel action.
If I could be assured that in the wonderful
national museum for which I have the honour
to collect there would stand through the ages
a monument to the memory of one, Amos
Bulkeley&mdash;&mdash;  It doesn't mould readily to Latin,
does it?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford sighed wearily.
</p>

<p>
The Professor stooped to look beneath the
blind.
</p>

<p>
"Your husband!" he announced across the
table.
</p>

<p>
Presently Cockney jerked Pink Eye to his
haunches before the door.
</p>

<p>
"Anything left to eat?" he called.  "I'm
starving."
</p>

<p>
"When Mr. Stamford has his fourth helping
there won't be," replied the Professor.  "He's
a past master at keeping others talking while
he eats."
</p>

<p>
"Stamford, take Pink Eye to the corral,"
ordered Cockney.  "The bottom corral, you
know.  He's too tired to be breezy."
</p>

<p>
"Here!  Let me tackle him."  The Professor
was advancing in a circle on Pink Eye,
as if with a vague idea of securing a strangle
hold before the broncho could put up a defence.
"If I could end the summer with the thought
that I'd handled a real devil of a broncho, my
pride would sustain me for a whole winter.
Even Gee-Gee seems to have lost all ambition."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you bother," Cockney growled.  "I'll
take him myself."
</p>

<p>
Stamford came forward valiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid of him," cautioned Cockney,
removing the saddle.  "If he cuts up, let him
go; he won't go far.  Here's the key to the
gate.  I think you'll find it swing easily enough.
We'll have real hinges and a new gate before
another season.  Be sure and lock up."
</p>

<p>
The Professor watched Stamford gingerly
lead the jaded horse away.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the heart to let him go alone,"
he decided, and set off running.  "If we don't
come back," he shouted over his shoulder,
"you'll find me gathering up what's left of
Mr. Stamford."
</p>

<p>
Stamford, turning at sound of the Professor's
heavy feet, saw Cockney standing before the
ranch-house, watching them in that speculative
way of his.
</p>

<p>
Pink Eye was honoured with a corral all
to himself, an unusually strong one of six-foot
fences, with a network of wire stapled about
it.  The gate, a clumsy affair of cotton-wood
logs, hinged to the post by heavy loops of iron,
was fastened at its other side by a chain
passing through a huge staple in the gate and
padlocked around the fence post.  This post
was sunk in the ground close to the main post
of the fence, apparently added to fill an
over-wide breach left by a makeshift gate.
</p>

<p>
The Professor took the key and pulled the
gate open for Pink Eye to scamper through.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" he growled.  "The key seems
a bit superfluous, with that contraption to
move before Pink Eye could get out."
</p>

<p>
He closed the padlock and started back for
the ranch-house.
</p>

<p>
"You're sure you locked it?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford, remembering Cockney's last words,
turned back.  To his surprise the loop had not
caught, though the Professor had turned the
key in the lock.  The latter, apologetic, returned
and corrected the mistake.
</p>

<p>
"They'd have thought we were too frightened
to do the job right," he remarked, with a sheepish
grin.  "Just the same, it's a tiresome rite to
go through for one lone broncho that wouldn't
go far if he got away."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," Cockney exclaimed, several minutes
after they were back in the sitting-room, "the
key!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor fumbled through his pocket
and produced it.
</p>

<p>
"Pink Eye must look on his corral," he
observed, "as the equine equivalent of a jail.
Is he in the habit of spending his evenings at
the corner saloon, or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a habit I have of wishing to reserve
my own things for myself," said Cockney
shortly.
</p>

<p>
"There are worse foibles," was the Professor's
sweet reply.  He gave the embarrassed laugh
that usually preceded a confession.  "One of
mine is ever so much less respectable.  I'm
simply scared to a panic at thought of
fire&mdash;fire anywhere&mdash;here at the
ranch-house&mdash;wherever I spend the night.  I know how
foolish it is, but my instincts are stronger than
my intelligence.  I must have been a wolf a
few lives back.  At home I always sleep
downstairs on that account."
</p>

<p>
"Unless both Stamford and ourselves give
up our downstairs rooms I don't see how we
can satisfy you at the H-Lazy Z," said Cockney.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'd have to be near him," put
in Isabel hastily.  "So it's quite impossible.
Please don't think of indulging his foolishness
any more."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate," said Stamford stubbornly,
thinking of the limitations imposed on his
uncertain night investigations by an upper
room, "I'm not going to give up my room until
my host orders it."
</p>

<p>
"Your host," said Cockney emphatically
"is going to do no such thing."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
PINK EYE AND THE ENGLISH SADDLE
</h3>

<p>
Stamford tossed about when he should
have been sleeping, worried by a thousand
questions, a thousand disturbing suspicions.
And through them all ran the thread
of his love for Isabel Bulkeley.  He could hear
her moving about her room, and long after
they should have been asleep, the voices of
brother and sister came to him in gentle murmur.
Added to this was the evidence of a similar
wakefulness in the Aikens' bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Imp came to his door and whined, and Stamford
let him in, glad of his companionship.
Thereafter, with the watchful little terrier
curled on his feet, he found it easier to drift
away.
</p>

<p>
He was awakened by Imp.  In the outline
of the window Stamford saw the dog's ears
erect, and a slight sniffing sound told of some
disturbing scent.  Stamford hurried to the
window.
</p>

<p>
The night was sharp and clear.  He shivered,
partly with excitement, partly with chill.
Something moved in the moonlight down the
slope toward the corrals, but it was gone so
quickly that he was uncertain of his eyes.
The moon was low and dull, with a thin mist
before it that prophesied the coming of winter.
He watched until his teeth were chattering,
then, with a pat to Imp's warm body, he
returned gratefully to the warm sheets and
settled to sleep.
</p>

<p>
He was wakened again by Imp leaping to
the floor to sniff beneath the door.  Out in
the sitting-room someone was moving, but there
was nothing furtive about it.
</p>

<p>
Then Stamford became conscious of a strange
rumble like distant thunder.  But it was no
noise of the elements.
</p>

<p>
Mary and Cockney were whispering outside
his door in excited tones.  Someone rapped.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be alarmed, Stamford."  Cockney
pushed open the door, speaking in a low voice.
"It's cattle on the run&mdash;a stampede....
But it's a small bunch.  They'll get them under
control.  The boys are riding now ... like
mad! ... Listen! ... Ah!  They have
them bunched! ... They'll stop by getting
in each other's way!  Not badly frightened,
I guess....  I wonder where they broke
from."
</p>

<p>
A moment longer he stood listening to the
waning sound.
</p>

<p>
"If you'd throw something on and come out
to the sitting-room I'd be grateful.  I'm going
out.  Mary's frightened....  I hope&mdash;I hope
we're not making our guests too uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there in three minutes," Stamford
promised, groping for his clothes.  "We'd
better tell the Bulkeleys; they'll wonder what
it is."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the Bulkeleys," returned
Cockney sharply.
</p>

<p>
Stamford could hear him pounding off to
the stables.  In what seemed seconds he was
galloping back below the house, making for
the west.
</p>

<p>
Opposite Stamford's window the horse dropped
suddenly back on its haunches.  Stamford
peered out.  Somewhere to the west came the
swift gallop of approaching horses.
</p>

<p>
But Cockney's eyes were fixed on the side
of the house.  Stamford saw them rise to the
Professor's window and drop again, while
the broncho pawed impatiently.  With a bend
of the hand Cockney turned the horse to the
house, where it drew up for a brief moment,
then, under digging spur, dashed to meet the
oncoming riders.
</p>

<p>
Stamford leaned out and saw the rope ladder
dangling from the Professor's window.
</p>

<p>
Before Cockney had gone a dozen paces the
ladder began to move rapidly upward.  In
the dim light Stamford imagined a small hand
reached out and drew it over the sill.
</p>

<p>
Thirty yards away Stamford and the approaching
horses met.
</p>

<p>
"Who's had Pink Eye out?" demanded
Dakota's angry voice.
</p>

<p>
There was a perceptible pause.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like your tone, Dakota," said
Cockney icily.  "When you want information,
there's only one way to get it."
</p>

<p>
"I found him out there on the prairie,"
Dakota blustered.
</p>

<p>
Cockney rode round the horse Dakota was
leading.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know he was out.  But first
you'd better answer my questions.  Where
did the cattle stampede from, and how did
they happen to be away off there?"
</p>

<p>
"What difference does that make?  But
if you want to know"&mdash;Dakota was plainly
sparring for time&mdash;"it was a bit of the Lost
Dog Coulee bunch.  They ran a long way
before we got 'em stopped.  Just a small
bunch.  What's more serious is Pink Eye out
there."
</p>

<p>
"Who's saddle's this?" Cockney was leaning
over Pink Eye's back.
</p>

<p>
Dakota laughed in a nasty way.  "Thought
maybe you'd know.  It's an English saddle.
Ever see it before?"
</p>

<p>
"By gad!  That's curious!  It's a racing
saddle of the lightest kind."
</p>

<p>
"I found the cinch unbuckled," said Dakota.
"We were a bit too quick for the fellow that
had him.  But we couldn't find him."  He
cursed..
</p>

<p>
Cockney rode up to Stamford's window.
</p>

<p>
"You there, Stamford?  Did you lock Pink
Eye in the corral last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Certain of it.  Both the Professor and I
tried the padlock afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Dakota spoke impatiently:
</p>

<p>
"Anyone out of the house now?"
</p>

<p>
"One moment, Dakota," snapped Cockney.
"I'll do the questioning.  I can answer that
one myself.  Everyone is in....  I think
I'd like to take a look at that corral," he said
suspiciously.  "Come along, Stamford; you
can tell us if things are as you left them.  Tell
Mary it's all right, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Stamford spoke to Mary Aikens on his way
out.  She was sitting in the dark sitting-room,
and he imagined she was sobbing.  He ran
after Cockney and Dakota, and arrived at the
corral in time to hear Dakota exclaim:
</p>

<p>
"Holy cripes!"
</p>

<p>
Stamford ran forward.
</p>

<p>
The gate was wide open, but the padlock
was still locked.  The ponderous mass of logs
must have been lifted until the chain would
pass over the top of the post to which it was
fastened.
</p>

<p>
"Holy cripes!" Dakota exploded again,
when he had examined padlock and post.
</p>

<p>
He stooped and put his muscle to the heavy
gate, but he could scarcely lift its weight from
the loops that acted as hinges.
</p>

<p>
Cockney smiled in a superior way and pushed
him away.  With a great heave he managed
to raise the gate from the ground, but he dared
not remove a hand to throw the chain over
the post.  With a muffled oath he let it drop,
and the upper loop snapped, letting the gate
sag on the lower hinge.
</p>

<p>
"That's two men's work," Dakota exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Three&mdash;at least," corrected Cockney thoughtfully,
"two to lift the gate, the third to remove
the chain."
</p>

<p>
Dakota looked fearfully about in the dim
moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;then there's a gang about!" he
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Come back to the house," said Cockney.
"It's worth looking into."
</p>

<p>
Beneath Professor Bulkeley's window he
stopped and called his name.  Mary Aikens
came timidly from the house, a lonely little
figure bathed in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Jim?"
</p>

<p>
He turned on her roughly.
</p>

<p>
"Go inside.  This at least is no concern of
yours."
</p>

<p>
She obeyed without a murmur, her feet
dragging forlornly over the frosty grass.
</p>

<p>
"Professor!  Professor!"  Cockney's voice
grew louder and more peremptory with each
call.
</p>

<p>
Isabel Bulkeley's head appeared in her window.
</p>

<p>
"Did you want my brother, Mr. Aikens?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not calling him at this hour of the
night for vocal exercise," replied Cockney.
</p>

<p>
"He's such a sound sleeper&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you'd better waken him."
</p>

<p>
"Is anything the matter?  I'll go and
call him."
</p>

<p>
They heard her bedroom door open, then
a knock on her brother's, and the turning of
the knob.
</p>

<p>
"Amos!  Amos!  Don't be frightened.  It's
only Isabel."
</p>

<p>
The bed creaked with sudden violence.
</p>

<p>
"Uh!  What&mdash;what's the matter?" sputtered
the terrified voice of the Professor.  "Is
it fire?"
</p>

<p>
His great feet pounded to the floor and across
the room to his bureau.
</p>

<p>
"Here&mdash;here!  Isabel!  Take these&mdash;and
these&mdash;and these.  I'll&mdash;oh, where's
that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Amos!  Amos, dear!"  She was laughing
a little now.  "It's not&mdash;fire.  Listen!
It's&mdash;not&mdash;fire."
</p>

<p>
"Not&mdash;fire?  Not&mdash;&mdash;  Then what's the
reason&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Aikens wants to speak to you&mdash;out
the window.  Put your slippers on first&mdash;and
this gown."
</p>

<p>
"Eh&mdash;Mr. Aikens?  Why&mdash;why, what's the
matter?"
</p>

<p>
The window opened wider and a night-capped
head was thrust out, only to be withdrawn
immediately.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel&mdash;Isabel!" he whispered, in a tone
that carried as far as if he had shouted it.
"Where's the ladder?  I'm sure I left it out
as usual.  It's&mdash;gone."
</p>

<p>
She spoke from dose beside him at the
window, laughing:
</p>

<p>
"I drew it in, you silly!  I didn't want
the whole world to see how foolish you are."  She
put her head from the window and called
laughingly down: "We always have trouble
with him like this, wakening him out of his
usual hours.  He'll be sane in a moment."
</p>

<p>
The Professor's head appeared again, this
time minus the night-cap.
</p>

<p>
"Say, is this a serenade?  On behalf of
myself and my sister, and the great Republic
we represent&mdash;&mdash;  Oh, that you, Mr. Stamford?
Where's your banjo?  Isabel's window is
the one over yours.  Fancy you making a
mistake like that!"
</p>

<p>
Even Dakota was laughing.  Stamford failed
to see the joke.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Professor," Cockney assured
him.  "We only wanted to make certain no
one was alarmed.  There was a slight disturbance
in a herd of cattle.  You can go back to
bed."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Aikens.  I won't leave
that ladder out again.  I wouldn't put it past
those New York museum people to have spies
on my track.  They haven't in their whole
collection such a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He sneezed, repeated it, doubled in volume
and noise.  The men beneath the window
laughed openly.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't mind, Mr. Aikens, will you
come round to my door.  I never could stand
the night air.  Could I, Isabel?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
PREPARATIONS TO FLIT
</h3>

<p>
The next morning Stamford was again
disappointed: the cowpunchers had
not returned.  He walked on from
the cook-house to Pink Eye's corral, to see by
daylight what had seemed so incredible in
the light of the moon.  On the way back he
saw the Bulkeleys driving to the north-west;
they were not crossing the river that day.
</p>

<p>
Carrying a lunch, he set off for the river
skirting far out on the prairie that he might
reach the canyon unseen far above where the
Professor was working.  Arrived at last in the
cover of the upper cliffs, he hurried on.
</p>

<p>
The hidden valley interested him.  There
he knew, lay the solution of some of the ranch
mysteries.  The stampede of the night before
was significant, for the H-Lazy Z herds never
ranged there.  The cattle, he decided, were
on their way to the raft and the hidden valley.
</p>

<p>
As he approached the valley he could hear
the dogs barking continuously but without
excitement.  He discovered that the valley
was lively with cowboys, the members he knew
best of the H-Lazy Z outfit.  They were moving
about the fringes of the herd, carefully avoiding
a bunch that kept to itself in a far corner of
the valley.  From its ragged and wild appearance
Stamford took it to be the addition of the
night before.  The others the cowboys drove
on foot to the eastern end of the valley, where
a temporary barricade crossed from cliff to
cliff, forming a corral at the base of the only
exit.  Then three of them disappeared, coming
into view again on their horses from behind
concealing crags.  At a word from Dakota
the two dogs that had been all the time slinking
close to his heels bounded up to the ledge
beside the shack and lay down, their eyes still
fixed on Dakota.  The mounted cowboys gradually
worked the new bunch toward the corral.
</p>

<p>
Evidently the cattle were being collected
at the exit for immediate removal.
</p>

<p>
About the shack Bean Slade was acting as
temporary cook.  The others, when all the
cattle were in the corral, grouped together,
rolling cigarettes.  Dakota seated himself on
a rock and whistled to the dogs, which came
madly bounding down the steps.
</p>

<p>
There was no suggestion of furtiveness.
Stamford began to think he had come on one
of the ordinary feeding grounds of the ranch
herds.
</p>

<p>
To get a better view behind the crags, he
crept farther up the stream and lower on the
cliff&mdash;crept into the muzzle of a revolver.
Behind the muzzle was Cockney Aikens'
determined eye.
</p>

<p>
"So it's you, Stamford?" he sneered.  "That
investigative mind of yours is bound to get
you into trouble sooner or later.  I wonder
it wasn't sooner.  It strikes me you're acting
strangely about the H-Lazy Z for a guest."
</p>

<p>
Stamford flushed, partly because he knew
the charge to be true, though not in the way
Cockney imagined.  Almost as much for Cockney's
sake as for his own had he undertaken
to clear up the mystery of Corporal Faircloth's
death; <i>more</i> for Cockney's sake had he chosen
the H-Lazy Z for his investigations.  He bristled
with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"If you're not as guilty as you make yourself
appear&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A guest with a sense of decency would at
least have consulted his host."
</p>

<p>
"And if you're guilty," Stamford continued,
"I don't care a damn whether you resent it or
not."
</p>

<p>
Cockney examined him with puzzled but
admiring eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if you'd be so foolhardy if Dakota
was at this end of the gun.  I'm not going to
shoot.  I'm still your host."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not, Cockney Aikens.  From
this moment I'm no longer your guest."  He
unstrapped the lunch and tossed it at Cockney's
feet.  "I suppose you'll let me get my
suit-case?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney thoughtfully returned the gun to
his belt.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll take the advice of one who knows
at last all you don't understand, you'll keep
so strictly out of this that you'll forget all you've
heard and seen.  You don't carry a gun&mdash;you
wouldn't be dangerous if you did.  Yet
there's going to be shooting before this is
cleared up ... and when there's shooting among
men who handle guns like we do, there's apt
to be blood....  This is the second time
I've found it necessary to warn you.  Next
time will be too late."
</p>

<p>
He crept away to a lower level and left
Stamford wondering what it was all about.
</p>

<p>
Across in the valley Dakota had gathered
his companions about him, except Bean, who
was still working about the shack.  Evidently
they were engrossed in a discussion of the
utmost importance, for several were gesticulating,
and Dakota was listening judicially.
Now and then their eyes went furtively to the
shack where Bean was.  Through the open
door Stamford could dimly see Bean watching
them stealthily through the window.  After
a time Dakota broke from the group and
climbed the steps to the shack.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes he and Bean reappeared
on the ledge, Dakota arguing violently, Bean
sullen.  Dakota started angrily down the steps,
but Bean stood a moment on the ledge, looking
thoughtfully across the river at the very spot
where Stamford was lying.  Then he, too,
dropped to the valley.
</p>

<p>
Dakota was striding down toward the river.
As he crossed one of the little streams that
bubbled from the falls in the cliff he stopped
abruptly and bent over the ground.  An excited
gesticulation brought his companions on the
run, and together they stooped over Dakota's
discovery.  The Professor had crossed the
streams there, Stamford remembered, and the
ground would be soft.  Hastily scattering, the
cowboys searched the valley.
</p>

<p>
It was long before Alkali, poking about close
to the river, came on a second track, and they
clustered about it, gesticulating, excited, voluble.
Stamford leaned far from his hiding-place in
his excitement, and Muck Norsley, wheeling
suddenly, examined the cliff all about him.
But the distance was too great, the muddle of
broken rock too confusing; and Stamford
scarcely breathed during the scrutiny.  When
it was over he sank to cover, and perspiration
broke out over him.
</p>

<p>
Dakota and his friends continued their search
up the eastern slope from the valley, pausing
now and then as if over further disturbing
evidence.  They climbed upward to the great
rock on which Cockney and the Professor had
stood, mounting from below by means of a rope.
For a time they worked about its base, then
it rolled back and the upward path was clear.
</p>

<p>
As the horses toiled up the steep ascent,
Stamford noticed that a rifle hung from every
saddle.  When they had passed, the rock rolled
back again, shutting in the valley, and only
the cattle in the corral and the dogs remained.
</p>

<p>
Stamford commenced his rough trail back
down the river, always keeping to cover.  Only
two definite ideas were in his mind: to escape
notice, and to reach the Bulkeleys to borrow
their team for the journey to the Double Bar-O.
His work at the H-Lazy Z was ended&mdash;and it
was a failure.  Almost he could find it in him
to regret that he had lost his temper with
Cockney.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
THE FIGHT IN THE RANCH-HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
Mary Aikens, alone at the
ranch-house, went about her morning work
with fumbling hands and tired brain.
The shadow of impending crisis was over her
though she recognised only the thickening of
a cloud of doubt, suspicion, and fear that had
been closing in on her for more than a year.
To her it was conviction enough of Jim's share
in the mysteries she was struggling single
handed to unravel, that he refused to take her
into his confidence.
</p>

<p>
The last act of her morning duties was always
a visit to the Bulkeleys' rooms.  Isabel had
refused to leave to her any of the care of their
rooms, but Mary Aikens, as hostess, never
omitted that morning visit to see that nothing
was lacking for their comfort&mdash;perhaps, too,
to dream a little over the wonderful thing
that had happened that summer to the H-Lazy
Z, the lonely ranch where never before in her
time had another woman set foot.  In Isabel's
kindly eyes and sympathetic silences she read
what one woman can tell another without the
perils of speech.  The Professor?  There she
always stopped short.  The only indulgence
she permitted her thoughts was that the
Professor needed most a strong and understanding
wife, indulgent&mdash;a little&mdash;but very firm at times.
He was a spoiled child she longed to mother.
</p>

<p>
Softly she closed the stair door behind her
and dropped on the seat before the piano.
In the kitchen the cook was doing his morning
cleaning with his usual noiselessness, only the
patter of his slippered feet and the subdued
rattle of dishes betraying his presence.  In
all the great north country were only the dim
sounds from the kitchen, and her absent-minded
fingers on the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
The great north country&mdash;the lonely ranch
she had had so long to herself, where for months
at a time she was cut off from every other
human being save the cowboys, and a husband
who was wilfully forcing her from his inner
life&mdash;the silent stretches had that year taken
on a different note.  Even those forbidding
cliffs, with their long, uneven lines, had become
the hunting ground of scientists&mdash;very human
scientists&mdash;a cemetery of bygone ages with
an absorbing story to tell.  Professor Bulkeley,
big, childlike in his simplicity, frank in his
likes and fears, with an instinctive strain of
gallantry so pleasing to one accustomed to the
stifled gentleness of the West and the proprietary
affection of her English husband&mdash;would he
ever come again?  Would there be enough
in that isolated land to lure him back another
year?
</p>

<p>
She hummed as she played, her eyes staring
vacantly at the wall before her.
</p>

<p>
When he uttered her name softly from the
open door she did not hear him.  But when
he repeated it, stepping into the room, her
face reddened hotly.  She tried to drop her
eyes from his but they refused her will;
something strange about his appearance held there
in spite of her.  He was without his spectacles.
Never before had she seen him thus.  It was
as if he had disrobed before her, so naked
did he appear, for the depths of simplicity
and dependence had gone with the horn rims.
Even his shoulders seemed to have straightened.
</p>

<p>
He must have noticed the flush on her face.
His lips moved as if he were speaking to himself.
Then, fumblingly, he put on the spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"That's funny," he said lightly, but his
face was pale.  "I didn't know you had that
bit of Chopin among your music.  So many of
the old masters suffer from the emotionless
piano.  Taming the ivory keys is an art so
many dabble at that almost none of them know
when they have mastered them&mdash;or care.  In
all of us our hearts are nearer our throats than
our fingers.  Please hum it again for me, will
you?"
</p>

<p>
He was speaking rapidly, nervously, and she
had time to force herself to a rational reply.
</p>

<p>
"To-night&mdash;maybe.  I&mdash;I didn't know what
I was playing; I didn't know I was humming
at all.  In reality I was only dreaming."
</p>

<p>
The recollection of her dreams revived the
flush in her face, and she rose abruptly from
the piano to hide her confusion.  He took one
quick step forward, but stopped himself with
a sudden breath.
</p>

<p>
"Is your husband in?  I'd like to see him."
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't returned yet."
</p>

<p>
He frowned with sudden impatience.
</p>

<p>
"I hoped&mdash;I thought he would surely be
back this morning.  I couldn't wait.  I wanted
to see him right away."
</p>

<p>
She came nearer to him and peered up into
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you want to see him?  Tell
me&mdash;please."  Her little hands were gripped over
her bosom.  "Oh, don't tell me you, too,
are mixed up in all these things.  I hoped there
was someone&mdash;someone I might talk to if
things went worse.  You stopped me once&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can be of no use to you,
Mrs. Aikens," he replied formally.
</p>

<p>
She shuddered and put her hands before
her face, and he turned away quickly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you need worry," he told her
in a low, lifeless voice.  "Your husband is
his own worst enemy.  I believe God intended
him to be a model in more than body
... but something went wrong&mdash;only temporarily,
I believe.  The jealous gods&mdash;the old very
human Greek gods may have been less a myth
than an allegory&mdash;touched his mind when it
was most sensitive."
</p>

<p>
She moved over to the side-table and began
to readjust the pile of papers.  She was strangely
moved by his defence of her husband.
</p>

<p>
"May I thank you, Professor Bulkeley, for
Jim's sake?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'd like you to," he stammered eagerly.
"It's an instinct to do one's best for Jim
Aikens&mdash;especially for <i>me</i>."
</p>

<p>
She realised then how near the danger line
they had been, and how firmly he had steered
them to safety.  It seemed to give her the
chance to place their relationship on the old
innocent level, when compliments were no
deeper than their wording.
</p>

<p>
"And what of Jim's wife&mdash;is she worthy
of such a paragon, or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Jim's wife," he repeated vaguely.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she's the evil influence you call a
god."
</p>

<p>
He turned on her with dilated eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You knew&mdash;you&mdash;knew?  My God!  She knew!"
</p>

<p>
Her knees were trembling with a sudden
overwhelming fear, but she stumbled over to
the table beside him and stared into his reluctant
eyes.
</p>

<p>
With a burst the outer door opened and
Cockney entered.  At sight of the two standing
there so close, the man's eyes falling before
hers, his great shoulders shook and his chin
went out.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  It was a breath rather than a word.
"So this is what you do when I'm away?
This is what guest number two does to requite
our hospitality?  Is this the way of palæontologists,
or of Americans, or"&mdash;his voice went
hard as steel&mdash;"of a sneaking cur who represents
nothing but the vicious things that make
beasts of men?"
</p>

<p>
A flame sprang to the Professor's eyes, but
the horror in Mary's quelled it, and he only
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You do not answer," Cockney hissed.
"You have at least the common sense to make
no denial.  There have been terrible things
happen in lonely places out here, but nothing
so bad as this, you dirty cad."
</p>

<p>
He faced his wife, his chest heaving and
falling.
</p>

<p>
"Go to your room.  I don't want witnesses."
</p>

<p>
But Mary Aikens had reached the limit of
her subservience.  She stood before him
unfalteringly and glared back into his furious eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Very well!"  He laughed recklessly.  "Perhaps
it's better so.  Perhaps it'll do you
good to see me twist the rotten life from
him&mdash;with these fingers&mdash;these fingers."
</p>

<p>
He held before him his great hands, the fingers
crooked like claws.  His eyes seemed to protrude,
and his teeth were bare like a beast's.
</p>

<p>
"She'll hear the screams from that big soft
throat of yours, you hound, and your dying
gasps.  And I'll laugh&mdash;I'll laugh!"
</p>

<p>
He crouched, the crooked fingers thrust
before him.
</p>

<p>
Professor Bulkeley had not moved since
Cockney entered.  Slowly now he removed his
spectacles and laid them on the table.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better leave the room, Mrs. Aikens,"
he ordered quietly.
</p>

<p>
"She's not going for you if she wouldn't
for me!" Cockney thundered.  "If she does,
I swear to God I'll kill her without mercy when
I'm through with you."
</p>

<p>
There were to be no blows in the struggle,
the Professor knew.  He was to be choked to
death with those claw-like fingers; the whistling
of his tightening throat was to be the triumph
of his mad foe.  So be it; neither would he
strike until he must.
</p>

<p>
As Cockney leaped the Professor neither
struck nor retired.  His body twisted far side
ways and his right arm wound round Cockney's
waist.  And the big rancher, who had never
yet met his equal, was lifted clear of the floor
and flung back almost to the wall.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens gasped.  She had thought of
but one outcome to the uneven struggle.
But the Professor was standing there as if
nothing had happened, while Cockney, stumbling
over a chair, saved himself from falling only
by thrusting a long arm against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Will you let me explain, Mr. Aikens?
It would be better for both of us&mdash;for you as
well as for me."
</p>

<p>
But Cockney was past reason.  A flash of
diabolical anticipation lit his face, making it
only the more terrible.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  So you have muscle under those
flabby clothes!  So much the better.  When
I've killed you there'll be no remorse.  It's
man to man, muscle to muscle.  We'll see
who's the stronger."
</p>

<p>
He advanced with the deliberation of
unflinchable purpose&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens stifled a scream to a moan.
</p>

<p>
The Professor met him half-way.  One wrist
in either hand he seized before Cockney could
dodge.  Cockney's right, clasped in the
Professor's left, went up.  The other the Professor
wrenched downward, and the pain of it made
Cockney's face twist.  Thus, face to face they
stood for seconds, muscle pressing against muscle,
Cockney straining to tear his wrists from the
bands of steel that gripped them.  Their heads
fell over each other's shoulders.  For one
moment of dizziness Mary Aikens thought her
husband's bared teeth would sink into his
opponent's back.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Cockney's left hand bent behind his
back.  He began to struggle with his whole
body, wrenching, fighting.  He read the
Professor's purpose.  It was body to body now.
The Professor's left hand was having its way
with Cockney's right.  Cockney saw defeat,
horrible defeat, staring him in the face.  He
let his left yield and concentrated on his right.
And inch by inch the Professor's left fell back
before it.  Another inch and his grip would
be broken.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens gasped.
</p>

<p>
The Professor heard it.  His teeth bared
like Cockney's, the lips drawn thin and
bloodless.  He, too, became the beast fighting for
his life.  His shoulders heaved a little, as if
new vigour had entered them&mdash;and his left
began to win back what it had lost.  Up and
up it moved, and straight above their shoulders
the arms halted.
</p>

<p>
To Mary Aikens they seemed to stand thus
for hours, neither yielding an inch.  It was
endurance as well as strength now, and surely
there the hardened rancher would win.  But
almost imperceptibly over Cockney's back the
arms began to move.  Cockney stiffened his
body against it, and with failure his back bent.
With the fury of insanity he writhed, but the
hold on him now was more relentless than ever.
</p>

<p>
With a groan that was as much shriek he
sank suddenly to his knees, blank incredulity
distorting his crimson face.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the Professor's hands fell from him.
Perspiration dripped from both swollen faces.
Cockney leaped back, dropped his head, and
charged with a bellow.  Foam was dripping
from his mouth.
</p>

<p>
The Professor met the lowered head with
his knee, stooped over Cockney's back and
encircled his waist, and tossed him in a
somersault over his head.  The high riding heels
crashed into the ceiling as they went over,
bringing down a shower of plaster and dust,
but the falling man landed on his feet against
the stove.  It fell with a clatter, and the pipes
went with it.
</p>

<p>
The Professor's teeth were still bared.  He
saw nothing now but the enemy before him,
the death that waited for either one of them.
With a heave he sent the table slithering into
the wall.  Crouching, circling, glaring, he moved
on Cockney.  It was to the death now.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens could stand it no longer.
</p>

<p>
"Don't, don't!" she cried.  "Oh, Professor!
Don't kill him, for my sake!"
</p>

<p>
Professor Bulkeley shivered, stopped where
he crouched, and with a long, quivering breath
straightened and moved backward.
</p>

<p>
On Cockney the effect was different.  A
moment ago his resources seemed to be
exhausted&mdash;baffled by this man he had ridiculed.  But
the appeal of his wife&mdash;to the Professor&mdash;<i>for
him</i>&mdash;drove the blood to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'll kill you!" he frothed.  "I'll kill you!"
</p>

<p>
He mouthed it like a madman, his great
head rolling loosely, his fingers closing and
opening.
</p>

<p>
"And you, too, you Jezebel!"
</p>

<p>
Through panting lips the Professor spoke:
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be the first time you'd done
a deed like that to a woman, would it&mdash;<i>Jim
Cathers</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Cockney staggered back, his hand fumbling
at his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Jim&mdash;Cathers!" he faltered.  "You know&mdash;that!"
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens' eyes dilated.  She came swiftly
to the Professor.
</p>

<p>
"Jim Cathers?  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
The Professor shifted his eyes to hers&mdash;and
Cockney sprang forward.  The Professor threw
up his arms but missed, and Cockney's right
hand wound round his neck and hooked beneath
his shoulder.  The shock and strain almost
dislocated the Professor's neck, and his eyes
closed, his legs shook.  He braced against the
wave of dizziness, but he was powerless against
such a hold of such a powerful maniac.  There
was nothing now but submission or a broken
neck.  Either meant death.  Burning waves
of agony and dull insensibility chased each other
through his head.
</p>

<p>
Cockney shouted derisively.
</p>

<p>
"Now&mdash;now!"
</p>

<p>
The Professor's arms fell limply away, his
knees bent.  A burst of agony parted his swollen lips.
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens saw only certain death to one
of them&mdash;and the other a murderer&mdash;if she
did not act quickly.  She seized a Chinese
vase from the piano beside her and, closing
her eyes, brought it down with all her might
on her husband's head.  Dimly she heard
staggering feet, the thud of a body, and then
she fell unconscious.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
COCKNEY'S STORY
</h3>

<p>
Her first impression was of a warm,
tender hand holding a cold cloth to
her temples.  She reached up and
seized it; but it was jerked from her grasp.
She opened her eyes and looked into Professor
Bulkeley's face bending over her.  Instantly
he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be all right now," he said coldly,
and left her.
</p>

<p>
It was so cruel.  She wanted to cry out
against him.  But across the room she could
see him and the cook bending over the prostrate
form of her husband.  A vague sense of the
emotions that must be controlling the
Professor closed her lips.  The cook retreated to
the kitchen, and they heard him close the back
door and pass rapidly away toward the ranch
buildings.
</p>

<p>
The Professor lifted Cockney against the wall.
He was partly conscious now, a large bandage
covering the upper part of his head.  He
looked over at his wife, puzzled.  Memory
returned to him in a wave, and he struggled
to stand up.  But the Professor's strong hand
pressed him back.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, Jim Cathers!  There are things you
should know."
</p>

<p>
He drew from an inside pocket a newspaper
clipping carefully folded in a piece of stiff paper,
and held it out to Cockney.
</p>

<p>
"You'll know by that that I'm not the man
to insult any man's wife.  Perhaps you'll realise
how I've held myself these many weeks."
</p>

<p>
He thrust the clipping into Cockney's nerveless
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I can trust it to you now&mdash;as well
as the next move.  You're a free man.  It's an
open race between us now....  But you've
the inside track&mdash;and I'll leave you there till
the decision's made.  I think I know Cockney
Aikens, if I didn't Jim Cathers."
</p>

<p>
Without looking at Mary he went out, though
she hungered for his eyes.  Cockney staggered
to his feet and sank into a chair, staring at the
clipping.  Once or twice as he read, the back
of his hand pressed against his forehead, and
at the end he closed his eyes.  Mary Aikens
stood leaning on the piano, scarcely breathing.
</p>

<p>
Presently he looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Mary."  His voice was like the
old courting days.  "I have a&mdash;a story to tell
you."
</p>

<p>
She sank to the piano seat, her arms
outstretched over the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
"It's a story that suffers from being
withheld from you so long.  You should have known
it&mdash;<i>Mary Merrill</i>&mdash;before you&mdash;you consented
to come here&mdash;no, you should never have heard
it, for it should never have been necessary to
tell you....  I thought the only one who
knew it was myself&mdash;it was my story&mdash;the story
of a broken, degraded life.  It is better&mdash;and
worse than I thought....
</p>

<p>
"<i>You are not my wife.</i>"
</p>

<p>
She was conscious of a numbing chaos or
emotions that clouded her brain&mdash;but there
was joy there with the bewilderment; joy&mdash;and
shame.
</p>

<p>
He drew a broken breath.
</p>

<p>
"You are not my wife&mdash;unless&mdash;unless ... I
was born in England&mdash;in Surrey&mdash;you need
know nothing more definite than that.  My
name is Jim Cathers&mdash;you heard it.  My people
had money&mdash;too much of it for my good.  There
are many in England like that....  I was
spoilt&mdash;spoilt as a baby, as a boy, as a youth....
It was in my youth it began to twist
my life.  My money&mdash;everyone knew of it.
That was part of my parents' creed.  The girls
about knew that Jim Cathers was the catch of
the country-side&mdash;they thought of nothing but
my money....  Money&mdash;and position&mdash;count
so much more in love over there&mdash;because all
men are not equal.  Love is more impersonal,
I suppose....
</p>

<p>
"There was one&mdash;Dorothy Swaine.  She
was a&mdash;a publican's daughter.  I have only
this excuse&mdash;a miserable one&mdash;that the publican
over there is rated differently from where you
were raised.  I met her on one of my orgies.  She
was pretty; I was a fool.  She wanted my money
and name.  I&mdash;I wanted ... Mary Merrill.
I loved her as much as my shallow nature in
those days knew how....  I married her."
</p>

<p>
He swallowed hard, and crushed the bit of
paper in his nervous hand, but smoothed it out
again carefully on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"We scarcely lived together.  Father and
mother were disgusted&mdash;insulted&mdash;disgraced.
In our family had been an actress or two of
no great reputation, it is true, morally or
artistically, and one of my uncles had married a
maid.  But always something was done to
gloss it over&mdash;money and position are called on
so often to do that&mdash;and the upper lips of the
Cathers remained stiff....
</p>

<p>
"Father brought me back from France&mdash;where
we had gone on our brief honeymoon&mdash;when
the money was spent....  Dorothy
... she was handed a sum of money....
She took it hanging round my neck with the
wails of a broken heart.  I didn't suspect&mdash;about
the money, and I swore I'd return when
I could keep her....  You see, I had been
trained to no profession.  I'd been to a Public
School, an expensive and exclusive one
... and they&mdash;that kind&mdash;do nothing to correct a
foolish lad's sense of proportion.  I was one
of a vast body over there whose only profession
is to uphold the family traditions and to spend.
That meant the Army&mdash;or the Church....
</p>

<p>
"The longer I was kept from her, the more
madly I thought I loved her....  Yes&mdash;the
more I <i>loved</i> her.  I want to be square: I did
love her.  One night I could stand it no longer.
I stole away from the house....  I remember
how I thrilled at the sight of the lights of her
father's inn.  I pictured her joy at sight of me.
I swore to myself never to leave her again.
There would be some way of making a home
for the rest of our lives.  You see, I didn't know
then she had taken the money.  I crept up to
the inn through the darkness, partly to surprise
her, partly that inquisitive eyes might not
carry back the story to my father.  Nine out of
ten of the neighbourhood would have leaped at
the opportunity of winning father's favour...
</p>

<p>
"I found her almost as I had pictured
her&mdash;leaning on the gate ... almost ... almost
... She was not alone...."
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens was listening with drumming
ears.  "You are not my wife&mdash;you are not my
wife!"  It kept ringing down everything else,
so that she heard him only as against a strong
wind that steals words and phrases.
</p>

<p>
"There was a man with her....  I heard
what they were saying....  I followed them...."
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
His voice trailed off to a whisper; his unseeing
eyes stared far through the paper spread on his
knee.
</p>

<p>
"When he was gone I&mdash;I took her by the
throat&mdash;I was a big, strong fellow even then&mdash;and
I squeezed&mdash;squeezed&mdash;squeezed.  I could
feel her breath bubbling through my fingers
... and then it ceased....  I flung her on the
ground and ran.  I told father.  He crammed
all the money he had in my pocket and started
me off for Liverpool....  I turned up here
in Canada as Jim Aikens....
</p>

<p>
"There isn't much more.  Father kept me
supplied with money through a firm of Winnipeg
lawyers.  There has been no stinting&mdash;the
name of Cathers must never be sullied again&mdash;so
long as I stayed away.
</p>

<p>
"For years I thought I had killed her&mdash;my
wife.  Not a word in all that time have I heard
directly from home.  I dared not write for
fear my letters would be traced, and neither
father nor mother have written me&mdash;ever
told me Dorothy did not die.  Until a year
after I married you I thought I was free to
marry."
</p>

<p>
Her hands fell from her face, a gasp of relief
broke from her.  He understood.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mary!  I never was brute enough to
marry you, knowing&mdash;my wife to be alive.
You are innocent&mdash;as I am&mdash;of that....
More than a year ago I saw her picture in a New
York paper.  She was on the stage&mdash;she'd come
to America&mdash;perhaps to look for me....
For some reason she had clung to her own
name&mdash;perhaps she expected me to recognise her,
for she was well known then.  I knew her cruel
smile, her smirking innocence, her shameless
invitation.  And I&mdash;I was a bigamist....
You were not my wife....  After that I went
to the dogs.  It was bad enough to have
murdered her, even for the cause I had; it was
worse to realise what I had done to you....
I married you too hastily, Mary.  I wanted
to stifle that gurgling breath that was always
ringing in my ears, to feel that I was bound at
last&mdash;everlastingly&mdash;to a woman I could safely
cherish....  I didn't love you for yourself
in those days, Mary, as I have learned to since.
And by the time I knew you were not my wife
I loved you too much to let you love me
until&mdash;until somehow I was purged, I didn't figure
how.  If separation must come to us, I didn't
want you to suffer as I would.  <i>I wouldn't let
you love me.</i>"
</p>

<p>
He bowed his head in his hands, and his great
shoulders shook.
</p>

<p>
"That is why I've&mdash;I've played the brute,
Mary.  God knows it hurt me more than it did
you.  But&mdash;but it was coming easier lately.
A man can't lower himself to that, even for
virtue's sake, without sinking a step.  Of late
I've sunk several.  One was jealousy.  You
weren't mine, but I wouldn't let anyone else
have you.  I hated that man&mdash;and now I know
why.  I've hated everyone, even the men who
look at you in town.  I think I've been going
mad for love of you, Mary....  And
now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was reading the clipping again.
</p>

<p>
"What have you there?" she asked, and
her voice was dead, hopeless.
</p>

<p>
"Dorothy Swaine is dead.  And I am free&mdash;free!"
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet.  A radiant light was
in his eyes, and his arms stretched out to her.
</p>

<p>
"Mary, do you understand?  I am free.
We can look the world in the face&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But in Mary Merrill's face was no answering
light.
</p>

<p>
"Jim!  Jim!" she wailed.  "Why&mdash;oh, why
didn't you trust me?  Why didn't you tell me
a year ago?"
</p>

<p>
He pulled up, swaying, and his hands fell
slowly to his side.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;Mary!"
</p>

<p>
It was the moan of despair, of freshly-lit fires
for ever extinguished.
</p>

<p>
Mary Merrill rose from the piano seat, her
hands tight against her cheeks, and tottered
to her room.  For a full minute he stared
unbelievingly at the locked door, then he lifted
his Stetson slowly from the floor and stumbled
out.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
THE CHASE AMONG THE CLIFFS
</h3>

<p>
The heart-stricken man staggered down
the gravel path before the house and
struck blindly across the prairie toward
the river.  Pink Eye, standing with
drooping rein, tilted his ears and neighed to
him, but he was deaf and blind to everything
save his bleeding heart.  Something in the
rugged lines of the river cliffs drew him on.
<i>There</i> was clamour to match the chaos in his
mind, <i>there</i> was solitude and loneliness where
to fight out the problem that stretched out and
on through the rest of his days.  Pink Eye
neighed again, and tried to follow sideways, but
a foot caught a dragging rein and pulled him up.
</p>

<p>
Cockney plunged through the long grass to
the height west of the ranch valley and dropped
limply into the first ragged peaks, where he lay
on his back, staring with unseeing eyes into
the cloudless sky.  His head was paining him,
and the bandage had slipped, but he thought it
all a part of his mental suffering.  Dimly his
mind went back to the beginning&mdash;to his fight
with Professor Bulkeley.  But defeat did not
trouble him now; the struggle was nothing
more to him than a series of pictures of Mary's
emotions.  A groan&mdash;a gasp&mdash;a cry&mdash;the swinging
of that small arm that settled the issue.
That was what blinded his eyes with tears and
shook his body with sobs.  There lay the
verdict he had sought so rashly to alter with
his story.  Love&mdash;he knew it now&mdash;was not a
thing of many lives.  One could not kill it and
hope ever again to breathe life into its nostrils.
Love&mdash;real love&mdash;came but once.  It lived but
once.  Like a leaf that withers before an icy
wind, love died for ever at the hand of cruelty.
</p>

<p>
For the past year&mdash;ever since he knew he had
no right to marry Mary&mdash;he had suffered trebly,
the ignominy of a bigamist, the horror of the
injury he had done her, and the tearing agony
of his grim fight to destroy her love before it
learned the truth.  And he only knew how well
he had succeeded in that when he would have
given his life to change it.  Ever since he had
laid foul hands on a woman's throat he had been
an insult to her sex.
</p>

<p>
Big Cockney Aikens covered his face and
shuddered.  If a lifetime of repentance&mdash;&mdash;  But
there was to be no chance for repentance&mdash;there
could be none without Mary.  He must
go on and on, living his life alone&mdash;no Mary,
no pardon of God or himself without Mary to
keep him straight.  The years ahead were a
long road of blank despair leading&mdash;where?
Without Mary, without friends, without hope,
without ambition or plans or pride&mdash;the end
could only be that to which he had been tending
this past year of reckless memory.
</p>

<p>
He rolled over on his face in his anguish.
Below him the cliff dropped away for more than
a hundred feet to a jumble of rock.  A few
yards of eroded eminences, and then the rushing
torrent of the river.  There lay peace&mdash;forgetfulness&mdash;an
end of the struggle.  He lay peering
down into it with misty eyes&mdash;wondering.
</p>

<p>
But Cockney Aikens' self-condemnation was
too deep for that.  His sin was too great for
such a simple ending.  His destiny&mdash;his
punishment&mdash;was to live until God cried quits and
gave him happy release.  Only addled cowards
thought thus to escape the penalty of their
misdeeds.
</p>

<p>
He clambered hastily to his feet and moved
to where a wide ledge lay beneath him, cutting
him off from the sheer drop to the river bottom.
He was too weak just then to fight temptation,
and he fled from it.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw Isabel Bulkeley.  She was seated
on the ledge, screened, except from above, by
the fallen rubble.  Hammer and chisel and
whisk lay at her feet.  Her hand supported her
chin, and her eyes were fixed on the river below.
She, too, was sad.  Cockney, sensitive to the
suffering of mankind, felt it in every line of
her figure.
</p>

<p>
Presently he saw her start and raise her head
as if listening.  The next instant she had seized
her chisel and was hammering at the rock at
her feet.
</p>

<p>
Around the face of the cliff only a few
yards away came Dakota Fraley, Winchester
strapped over his shoulder.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Stamford wound his way slowly from before
the hidden valley, along the rocky lip of the
Red Deer canyon.  His arms and legs ached,
and his mind was wearier still, but he crept
carefully along like a conspirator.  He knew
that somewhere farther down the river he
would find the Bulkeleys; he was thankful
that that day they had chosen the south side
for their explorations.
</p>

<p>
With the thought came another: his days
with Isabel Bulkeley were over&mdash;he might
never see her again.  Slow as was his progress
in the roughness of the way and the care of his
advance, he was in no hurry.  So long as he was
away by nightfall he would be satisfied&mdash;the
longer it was delayed, the better.  He settled
himself in the comfortable hollow of a rock.
</p>

<p>
A man burst from the prairies above, far
ahead of him, leaped to the cover of the upper
rocks, and in one swift glance swept the cliff
below.  With scarcely an instant's pause he
dropped into a crevice, and Stamford could
see him working a perilous but rapid descent
with back and hands and knees.  Reaching a
ledge, he began to leap downward from rock to
rock like a goat, swinging himself by his arms,
unhesitating, sure-footed.
</p>

<p>
Stamford blinked as the huge figure of
Professor Bulkeley threw itself down the last height
and landed on the water's edge.
</p>

<p>
There he paused only long enough to cast
one quick glance upward at the height behind
him, another on either side into the torrent,
then he leaped far out into the water.  Stamford
gasped.  It was nothing short of suicide.
Human flesh or human muscle could not master
the rush of that foaming current.
</p>

<p>
There the sullen eddies told of a fierce pull
beneath&mdash;and out beyond was the bubbling
foam of rocks crowding the surface.
</p>

<p>
The Professor disappeared.  But the big
head came up farther down, shook itself like a
spaniel, and started for the other shore.
Stamford swept the lashing water with his glasses,
but there was nothing now to be seen save the
roaring torrent.
</p>

<p>
He climbed warily upward.  Something out
there on the prairie&mdash;something of dire
peril&mdash;had driven the Professor to such a risk.
</p>

<p>
Peering over the edge, he saw a circle of
mounted cowboys closing in on the place where
the Professor had disappeared.  They were in
no hurry.  Dakota and his companions knew
that cliff&mdash;they knew the hopelessness of escape
from their pursuing vengeance.  Dakota laughed
wildly and waved his rifle; Alkali drew his hand
expressively across his mouth, and General
took a last look at his rifle.  Fifty yards from
the cliff edge they dismounted and came on,
crouching, creeping in on their prey.  When
no shot greeted them, they moved faster,
tightening the arch of the circle.
</p>

<p>
"It's a shame to take the money, boys,"
jeered Dakota.  "The old fossil thought he
could make it here.  He don't know these rocks.
Anyway there won't be no funeral service;
the grave's just yawning for him down there."
</p>

<p>
He was on the edge now, looking down to the
river.  They spread out in sudden surprise and
alarm, searching among the upper rocks with
drawn revolvers; several of them carried their
rifles as well.  The foreman started down,
leaving his rifle at the top.  Right and left was
unscalable wall; below, it seemed almost as
impassable.  They were puzzled&mdash;furious.
</p>

<p>
A mocking laugh drifted to them above the
rattle of the waters.  Across the river, three
hundred yards below them, the Professor was
standing, waving his hand.  Bean Slade threw
forward his rifle and fired, and a chip of rock
broke into the air several yards above the
mocking foe.  The Professor waved again and
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Dakota, his face livid, climbed up to the
prairie.
</p>

<p>
"Get back to the ranch.  Take my horse
with you.  I'll attend to this little affair myself.
One of us isn't going to sleep in no bed this
night....  Besides, I got a little personal
matter to settle, and this seems a mighty good
chance.  You fellers wouldn't be interested."
</p>

<p>
He jerked his Winchester back over his
shoulder and started down-stream.
</p>

<p>
The others rode away, laughing significantly.
Stamford slunk from his hiding-place on
Dakota's trail.  He had no idea what was in
Dakota's mind, but in that mood he was
dangerous, and it was someone's business to
keep an eye on him.
</p>

<p>
Presently, far down the river on the other
shore, something moved among the rocks.
Dakota was invisible in a bend in the cliff, and
Stamford fixed his glasses on the spot and
watched.  The Professor was there, straining
at something, jerking forward as if for a fresh
hold, and pulling back slowly again.  To
Stamford's amazement the raft came foot by foot
into view from this side of the river and moved
out toward the straining figure.  And on it
was Gee-Gee.  The jerking of the craft made
the horse rear once or twice, and his legs were
braced in terror.  Stamford noticed then that
the raft was turned for the opposite passage,
the higher end toward the shore it was leaving.
</p>

<p>
Against the pressure of that current, with
Gee-Gee aboard, Professor Bulkeley was pulling
the raft by sheer force of muscle and the weight
of his body.
</p>

<p>
By the time Dakota came into view again
Gee-Gee and the Professor had passed into the
rocks on the other side.  In time the cowboy
arrived at the mooring platform.  He saw the
raft across the river and sat down under cover
to think.  In a minute he lifted a huge stone
and approached the end of the cable.  A few
heavy blows severed it, and the wire, with a
spitting of fume, sank into the stream.  The
raft, freed, floated down the current, bumped
against hidden rocks, splintered, split apart,
one section swinging to destruction lower down.
</p>

<p>
Dakota lifted his head and laughed into the
opposite cliffs.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
THE BATTLE ON THE CLIFFS
</h3>

<p>
Stamford came to the raft-landing on
the river's edge, tired and perturbed, and
seated himself to rest.  He was very weary
and hungry.  Dakota had gone on faster and
faster.  Suddenly Stamford remembered that
somewhere ahead, down that cliff, Isabel Bulkeley
would be waiting for her brother.  He picked
himself up in a fever of anxiety and plunged
recklessly on.
</p>

<p>
He was still far away when he saw them&mdash;Isabel
and Dakota.  The cowboy was sitting
boldly on a rock close to her, one foot swinging.
His Stetson was pushed to the back of his head,
and now and then he threw back his head to
laugh.  Isabel did not laugh.  Stamford saw
her withdraw suddenly and turn, and Dakota
reached swiftly for her, seizing her arm.  She
struggled but did not scream.  Dakota laughed
and drew her to him.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Cockney Aikens hurled himself
from above and landed on all-fours close to
Dakota.  The cowboy recoiled, leaped farther
back, and his hand went to his belt.  Cockney
raised himself, lunged, and Dakota flashed
his gun and fired.  Cockney halted for but the
fraction of a second, then his great fist landed
on Dakota's face, and the cowboy tumbled back
among the rocks.
</p>

<p>
Cockney seemed to go limp then; he sank to
his side.  But he turned to Isabel and pointed,
and she dropped behind a rock.  The wounded
man rolled himself slowly to cover.  Dakota
was nowhere to be seen.  Cockney threw his
left arm over the rock to ease his position, and
a spot of smoke broke from the place where
Dakota was hiding, and the arm slid off and
Cockney fell back in a contorted position.
Another burst of smoke, and Isabel ducked.
Dakota was keeping them both to cover.
</p>

<p>
Stamford dashed upward to the prairie to
make better speed.  He could see Cockney
better now.  His left arm lay limp.  One side
of shirt and trousers was soaked with blood.
His one sound hand reached up and pushed a
bandage from his eyes.  On the exposed rock,
ten yards away, lay his revolver.  In his leap
from the rocks it had fallen from his belt.  He
was unarmed, of which Dakota was evidently
ignorant.  Cockney's hand was fumbling at
his belt.  Isabel, too, had her eyes on the
revolver.
</p>

<p>
Stamford dropped to cover in the upper rocks
behind Isabel to consider the situation.  Then
he advanced stealthily to the edge of the open,
drew a long breath, and dashed out on the ledge
where the revolver lay.  He scooped it up and
tossed it to Cockney.  As he turned Dakota
fired.  A hot needle pierced his left shoulder.
A second bullet missed him altogether, though
it fanned his hair.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!" he exclaimed, as he sank beside
Isabel.  "Gosh!"
</p>

<p>
It was so boyishly inadequate that Isabel
smiled through the fear that had come into her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" he jeered.  "I thought those
cowpunchers were dead shots."
</p>

<p>
He kept his left shoulder away from her and
settled down with his back to the rock.  He
did not ask for an explanation.  It only mattered
that Dakota was on one side and the other
three of them on the other.  Cockney, by the
sound of things, was making it hot for Dakota,
now that he had his gun.  A curse from the
cowboy registered a nip.  Stamford grinned
foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"I bet on Cockney," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But he's wounded, terribly wounded."
</p>

<p>
He raised himself to look over.  Cockney
was lying on his stomach far out from cover.
His left arm was horribly unnatural, but his
right held the gun pointed at the rock behind
which Dakota lay.
</p>

<p>
A flash of movement brought an immediate
report from Cockney's revolver, and Dakota's
gun rattled out on the open ledge.  A second
shot sent it far out of reach.
</p>

<p>
Cockney's plan was evident: Dakota was
not to be allowed to take aim.  The cowboy
was a two-gun man, Cockney knew.  A Stetson
showed above the rock, but Cockney ignored it;
bits of rock jerked up in the air but failed to
draw fire.  Suddenly Dakota exposed his second
gun and fired, Cockney returning it instantly.
Both seemed to have missed.  The chance
shot was repeated from the other side of the
rock, and Cockney failed to reply.
</p>

<p>
For a minute or two the battle waned.
Dakota tried a third shot.  Both guns spoke
together.  Stamford, his eyes held by the
recklessness of the wounded rancher lying there in
the open, saw one of his feet jerk.  At the
same moment Dakota's second gun jangled
among the rocks, though it did not come into
view.  They waited for its reappearance, but
evidently the shot had damaged it.
</p>

<p>
"He has a rifle, Cockney," Stamford shouted.
</p>

<p>
Cockney nodded without turning his head.
</p>

<p>
After a long time the rifle snapped, but it
did not show.  Twice it was repeated.  Dakota
was summoning his friends.
</p>

<p>
An answering volley burst out down the river,
followed by the shouts of the cowboys.  Dakota
jeered.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Cockney Aikens, comes the end
o' the chapter.  I knew you been tracking us
all summer.  You've drawn your little share
of the rustling manys a year without knowing
it&mdash;but there'll not be a damn cent for you of
the big bunch we're taking out to-night.  Then
we'll scoop all that's left&mdash;including dear little
Mary and the girl there."
</p>

<p>
Stamford took a chance.  He looked out to
the east.  The cowboys were coming on the
run, darting from cover to cover.  At the end
of the ledge they separated, some slinking over
the edge to work up behind.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you killed Kid Loveridge at
Dunmore Junction that day," Dakota went on,
"just 'cause he shot a slinking Policeman who'd
'a' got us shore if he hadn't.  I've always held
one bullet for you ever since.  If you'd told
the Police you'd 'a' got it sooner.  You didn't
know I fired the other bullet that got the
Corporal.  I only wish I'd been nearer to help
the Kid.  You was too quick on the draw for
him."
</p>

<p>
Cockney was stiffly trying to drag himself to
cover, his eyes darting about for a place to make
a last stand.
</p>

<p>
"Stamford," he called, "can you get her to
one of those fissures&mdash;the one my right foot's
pointing at?  I can protect you from here, I
think."
</p>

<p>
Stamford examined the crevice.
</p>

<p>
"It's too far," he said.  "We're not badly
off here."
</p>

<p>
Cockney's revolver spat, and Muck Norsley
flopped from the edge of the cliff and lay half
in the open.  Two others bolted across and
sank out of sight.  Cockney fired again but
missed.  Two of their enemies were now at
their backs.
</p>

<p>
Stamford moved round Isabel and watched
behind.  A rifle barrel came slowly into sight
and dropped until it almost covered them&mdash;then
the peak of a Stetson.  He raised himself
to protect the girl at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Isabel," he whispered, "it looks as if it's
about time to say something&mdash;to tell you that&mdash;I
love you.  If you can say anything that'll
make me go with a smile&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
His eye was on the rifle.  He hated the
thought of being shot in the back.  But the
rifle lifted unexpectedly to the sky, and Bean
Slade reared his bony shoulders into view.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a woman, boys!" he shouted,
with a scornful laugh.  "A woman!"
</p>

<p>
"Bean," growled Stamford, "it may seem
ungrateful, but why didn't you wait a second?"
</p>

<p>
"Shoot, you blasted idiot!" shrieked Dakota.
"They're all in it.  Get the boss and that
editor-fellow anyway."
</p>

<p>
Stamford grinned sheepishly at Bean's
lanky figure leaning over the rock, and turned
to Isabel.
</p>

<p>
"I guess it's up to me to postpone the tale.
I'm a bit too thin-skinned for this kind of a
game."
</p>

<p>
"You don't <i>need</i> to postpone it&mdash;Morton,"
Isabel whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, shoot, and do it quick!" muttered
Stamford.  "Before I waken.  Do you know,"
he said, with a whimsical smile, "I've a feeling
we're going to pull through."
</p>

<p>
Ten yards from Bean Slade rose the ruddy
countenance of General Jones.  Deliberately
he raised his rifle.
</p>

<p>
Like a flash Bean fired, and with the report
General crumpled out of sight.
</p>

<p>
"That's for Billy Windover," cried Bean,
expectorating.
</p>

<p>
With the shot Cockney turned his head
weakly.  Dakota heard General's single cry and
stood out in the open to fire.  Without a groan
Bean slid from the rock.
</p>

<p>
"And that's for General," hissed Dakota,
dropping to cover.
</p>

<p>
Bean lifted his head and looked into Stamford's
eyes.  A slow smile passed across his
lean features.
</p>

<p>
"Ta-ta!" he murmured, and dropped back
lifeless.
</p>

<p>
Stamford's eyes were blinded with tears.
For the first time an overpowering fury rose
within him.  He reached to his pocket and drew
a small automatic.
</p>

<p>
"Damn!" he exploded.  "I forgot all
about it."  He fumbled the little weapon in
unaccustomed hand.  "But what does the
beastly thing do?  I never fired one in my
life."
</p>

<p>
She grabbed it from him and fired, and a
figure that had been trying to creep across
behind them darted back.  Cockney turned his
head and smiled wanly at them.  His gun was
lying beside him now; he seemed too weak
to help.
</p>

<p>
"I'll just toddle over and get Bean's rifle,"
Stamford announced.  "I seem to be useful
only as an ammunition wagon in this fracas.
Never fired a gun in my life, but I'll close my
eyes and&mdash;darn the consequences!  It may
scare them almost as much as me.  If I could
only hit that rock in front of Dakota&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He had risen to his feet, but she seized his arm.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going with you," she said.
</p>

<p>
He blinked into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That means?"
</p>

<p>
"It's dangerous; you're not going without me."
</p>

<p>
A shot broke from behind them and struck
the rock above their heads.
</p>

<p>
"I think," smiled Stamford, "the second
instalment of that serial is about due.  I love
you, Isabel."
</p>

<p>
For answer she reached up and pulled his
lips to hers.  At the kiss he paled.
</p>

<p>
"Life without this," he sighed, "could
never equal death with it."
</p>

<p>
"But why not life <i>with</i> it?" she smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That," he said, "is worth any risk."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, but she was watching the
rocks behind with raised revolver.
</p>

<p>
Alkali Sam shouted:
</p>

<p>
"D'ye want the gal, Dakota?"
</p>

<p>
"You're shore right I do, old hoss!"
</p>

<p>
"Cudn't yo hang the li'l editor-chap t' yer
watch chain?  He don't seem wuth powder."
</p>

<p>
Stamford glared.
</p>

<p>
"Keep one bullet," he ordered Isabel.  Then
he smiled.  "They don't seem to like me."
</p>

<p>
Alkali was shouting a ribald song as he
climbed upward for a better shot.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Stamford, "things are going
to happen."
</p>

<p>
What happened was a new sound from across
the river&mdash;the pound of a running herd.  Silence
fell suddenly over the tragedy on the ledge;
every eye was turned to the opposite cliffs.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly along the edge of the cliff galloped a
bunch of steers, their tails held high.  And
driving them on was Professor Bulkeley,
mounted on Gee-Gee, two huge dogs bounding
before him.
</p>

<p>
Stamford peered over the rock at Cockney&mdash;he
could not help it.  But Cockney was almost
past surprise.  Dakota and his comrades were
shouting to each other excitedly.  Isabel was
laughing at Stamford from the corner of her eye.
She nodded to his unspoken query.
</p>

<p>
But between them and the help in sight an
impassable canyon ran.
</p>

<p>
The Professor, with the roar of the cattle
and the river in his ears, had heard nothing.
He would pass them by without a suspicion
that within rifle range his sister and friends were
in direst peril.  Stamford and Isabel shouted,
but no noise they could make would carry
against the clamour closing the Professor in.
Isabel fired into the air until the automatic was
empty.  It was useless.
</p>

<p>
Stamford darted to Bean's lifeless body.
Leaning the rifle on the rock he took as careful
aim as he knew how at the running cattle, but
missed.  He repeated the failure.  Then, reckless
of exposure, he carried the rifle to Cockney.
Lifting the heavy man to his side, he thrust the
rifle before him and held it against the rock.
Cockney's face twisted in pain, but he placed
his eye to the stock, held his breath, and pulled
the trigger.
</p>

<p>
A steer leaped, stumbled, and those behind
trod over it.  A second time a steer fell.
Cockney sank back.  He could stand it no
longer.
</p>

<p>
As the first steer went down, the Professor
pulled up sharply.  He had not heard the shot,
but he recognised the results.  The next shot
he heard.  And then a third snapped from the
rock where Dakota lay, and Gee-Gee sank to
his side.
</p>

<p>
Dakota sent a piercing whistle over the river,
and the two great dogs came slinking to the
edge of the cliff and lay looking over.
</p>

<p>
Dakota jeered aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Them was two fine pups the Inspector got
for us, Alkali.  I'll borrow dogs like them
any time they come to the West.  I need 'em
in my biz."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for Dakota Fraley an' his glad eye!"
shouted Alkali.  "Dakota, boy, you're a devil
with dogs an' skirts."
</p>

<p>
A rifle-shot broke from across the river.
Dakota Fraley raised himself with a spasmodic
jerk, a look of shocked incredulity on his
swarthy face, and fell full length out on the
ledge.  His limbs scarcely twitched as he lay.
Cockney smiled weakly.
</p>

<p>
Alkali and Dude could be heard seeking cover
from the newer peril.  Again and again the
rifle-shots came from the unseen marksman.
Bits of rock flew about the two cowboys.
Stamford rose in his excitement and waved his hat.
He could see bullet after bullet flash a white
sideways mark on the face of the cliff, and the
chips rise lower down where the bullet had bent
its course.  At the fifth shot Alkali cried out.
Richochet shooting was an art even he, notorious
gunman as he was, had never learned.
</p>

<p>
The firing ceased as suddenly as it had begun.
The Dude remained.  Suddenly above them a
stern command rasped down.  Two Mounted
Policemen leaned over the edge of the cliff,
their rifles covering Dude.
</p>

<p>
The cowboy stepped out, his arms up.  The
battle on the ledge above the Red Deer was
ended.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Stamford and Isabel ran to Cockney.  He was
lying at full length, his left arm crumpled under
him.  The bandage on his head had slipped.
He looked up in Stamford's face and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"My guest&mdash;to the last&mdash;anyway, Stamford.
I'm going to&mdash;beat you&mdash;away&mdash;from
the H-Lazy Z."
</p>

<p>
Isabel whispered to one of the Mounted
Police, who dashed up to his horse and rode
away.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;don't touch me.  Let me lie&mdash;awhile.
Where's the Professor?"
</p>

<p>
An exclamation from Sergeant Prior drew
their eyes to the opposite shore.  The Professor
had jumped into the river&mdash;he could not wait
to go round by the ford.  They watched, Stamford
satisfied that what the powerful fellow
had done once he could repeat, Isabel alarmed,
Sergeant Prior frankly sceptical.
</p>

<p>
They did their best for Cockney where he
lay, but there was so little to be done.  When
they attempted to lift him, he swooned, and they
left him at last and waited&mdash;waited.
</p>

<p>
The dripping Professor bounded up the rocks,
scrambling from foothold to foothold.
</p>

<p>
"You're safe, dear?" he panted, when
Isabel ran to him.
</p>

<p>
For one terrible moment Stamford stared at
them.  She read his fear and touched his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Morton, Morton!  He is only a brother.
I've been helping him in this case&mdash;I do sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, Prior!" cried the Professor.  "I
feared you'd be too late.  I stampeded the cattle.
I had to.  They were taking them away
to-night."  Then he saw Cockney.  "My God,
Aikens!  What have they done to you?"  He
sank beside the wounded man.
</p>

<p>
"This is&mdash;my bad day," murmured Cockney,
with a twisted smile.  "First you thrashed
me&mdash;now I'm&mdash;on the way, Professor."
</p>

<p>
"Not Professor, Cockney&mdash;Amos Barnes, of
the Mounted Police."
</p>

<p>
Cockney smiled.  "I suspected....  I
helped you&mdash;what I could.  But I hated&mdash;the
Police so.  <i>Your</i> English saddle....  Pink Eye
yours now without&mdash;breaking into the
corral&mdash;at nights."
</p>

<p>
Mary Aikens ran along the ledge and sank
by his side.  She was out on Matana when the
Policeman found her.
</p>

<p>
"Jim!  Jim!"
</p>

<p>
He pressed her feebly back with his right
hand.
</p>

<p>
"No sentiment&mdash;Mary....  I&mdash;haven't
time.  You're&mdash;in good hands.  This is the
best way&mdash;out."  His breath was coming in
gasps.  "Now&mdash;now, Mary Merrill&mdash;just one
kiss&mdash;to help me on my way ... in memory
of ... what might have been.  If&mdash;Amos&mdash;doesn't
mind."
</p>

<p>
She touched his lips tenderly with her own,
and the tears rained on his face.  He opened his
eyes, and the sweet smile of big, kindly,
light-hearted Cockney Aikens relieved the end.
</p>

<p>
Amos Barnes gently raised the weeping
woman to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"He died as you would have him die, Mary,"
he whispered.  "In his death you loved him
as never in his life.  And that's how Jim would
have it.  You're going home now&mdash;to your
mother.  We'll look after the ranch.  I'll come
to you when you send for me....  Poor Jim!
The whole country loved him&mdash;-but he'll rest
best out here on the cliffs of the H-Lazy Z,
where he found himself."

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
